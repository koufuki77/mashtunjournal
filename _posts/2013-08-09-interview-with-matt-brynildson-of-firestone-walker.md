By Ed Marszewski _ Published in Issue 2 of Mash Tun Journal.

Matt Brynildson was first introduced to craft beer in the late 1980s, when he was a student living in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and a Bell’s Porter convinced him to try home-brewing. And it was at Larry Bell’s home brew shop where Bryn procured his first equipment and started hanging out on the local home-brewing scene.

<em>After college Matt started working in the lab of the Kalamazoo Spice Extraction Company, and he was soon sent over to Chicago’s Siebel Institute, where he continued his education in organic chemistry. Today, he’s well on his way to becoming one of the world’s best brewers.</em>

<strong>Ed Marszewski (EM)</strong>: So how did you get your first brewing gig?
<strong>Matt Brynildson (MB):</strong> The Kalamazoo Spice Extraction Company sent me to the Siebel Institute in ’95. And while I was at Siebel, I found out that Goose Island was looking for brewers to start up the Fulton plant. That was their first year. And I got hired on about six months after as an entry level cellar man because I had a chemistry background.

Greg [Hall of Goose Island] kind of gave me the “Yeah, we’ll see how long you stick around”-kinda talk, the “we’ve seen a lot of people come and go.” They had built out a lab but never had the time or the manpower to get it rolling. So that was my first assignment: to get the lab going.

And that was a wonderful vector for getting into the industry because there were a lot of people who knew how to make beer and there were a lot of people with experience, but there were not as many people coming from the lab side of the business.

<strong>EM:</strong> Probably not many at all, back then.

<strong>MB:</strong> So it was awesome. And you know, Goose Island—love or hate them, that environment was truly an awesome place to learn brewing. I have nothing but huge respect for the Halls and everything they did for craft beer in Chicago.

Another lucky thing about being in the right place at the right time is that Siebel Institute was in town. So if we had any questions, we could go straight to the school. Over time we got to know all the instructors personally and I got to go through pretty much all the Siebel classes, because Goose Island would take on interns and trade services. It was an amazing time for learning craft beer. I had an accelerated learning curve, that first year with Goose Island.

<strong>EM:</strong> That was 1996? 1997?

<strong>MB:</strong> 1996 was the first full year of production, and Goose Island broke all the records by producing twenty-five thousand barrels of beer. At the time the Brewers Association recognized them as the fastest start-up micro in history, though it’s possible somebody else has done it since then. So it was just trial by fire, it was just amazing.

The people who worked at Goose are everywhere now. Jim Cibak went on to become Head Brewer at 3 Floyds and now he’s at Revolution Brewing along with Josh Deth. Gary Nicholas is the Quality Manager for Bell’s, he was a cellar man at Goose. Greg Brown, Head Brewer at Mickey Finn’s, is a Goose alum. And Phin DeMink was my homebrew partner in Kalamazoo, we were home-brewing before we were 21. Phin’s even a few years younger than me. I was Head Brewer at Goose from 1996-2000, and when I left I handed the reins over to Phin. I mean, it just goes on and on, there are so many great brewers who have learned and cut their teeth at Goose. It was just a great place to learn to brew beer.

<strong>EM:</strong> What do you remember about back then, do you have any nostalgia? Chicago was a dead craft beer town, pretty much. I mean, there was Map Room and Hopleaf . . .

<strong>MB:</strong> There was Map Room and Hopleaf, and and in those days there was Chicago Brewing Company. Big Shoulders Porter was one of theirs, and there was the German place, the Weinkeller, and some other bars. So there was some craft brewing going on, but I think what Goose brought to the table for Chicago were really solid recipes and consistent quality.

And Greg Hall is brilliant, as far as formulation. He is a real history buff so he gets it, he really knows the roots of these styles. So I credit the Halls for bringing craft beer to Chicago.

<strong>EM:</strong> Yeah, they’re pretty much responsible for getting people to try it. Many people’s first taste of craft beer here was either 312 or Honker’s.

<strong>MB:</strong> We were just talking about this last night at the Revolution beer dinner. In 1996, 1997 there were very few dry-hopped beers available here. You had Celebration Ale on the West Coast and you had Liberty Ale, but there were very few dry-hopped beers in Chicago.

So we almost felt like we were kind of pioneering some of these dry-hopping techniques. We were practicing with pellets on non-pasteurized beer, and we actually brewed the Amber Street beer for Goose. It was the first dry-hopped beer. And we just figured out how we were going to do this by trial and error, just by trying stuff out and feeling through it. And we were there when Goose Island IPA was formulated, and that was a huge success for the company.

<strong>EM:</strong> Would you fuck up a lot? Would you make batches and then go “Oh shit, how do we fix this?”

<strong>MB:</strong> We were making a lot of mistakes. Looking back, there were a lot of things we were doing that I look back on and think, “God I can’t believe we got away with that!” Or “Wow, we really learned why you don’t do those kind of things.” And a lot of it was just simple technique. These days there is so much good, well-made beer in the marketplace, you can’t just go to trade with an oxidized beer or an inconsistent product. Back then I think the market was a little more forgiving, and I think people were learning, for themselves, what quality beer was. But we did hit that kind of proverbial wall in the late 90s, we were were in double digit growth and then, around 1998 or 1999, everything went flat. There were too many bad beers in the market.

<strong>EM:</strong> That’s the first so-called bubble burst, right?

<strong>MB:</strong> Yeah, everyone started a contract brand and there was a lot of venture capitalist money out there, and a lot of people were trying to copy the Sam Adams and Pete’s Wicked Ale model of not owning a brewery, of contract brewing, and coming up with good marketing. And then consumers just got kind of confused and fed up.

You know, the quality wasn’t quite there. They were asking people to pay more money for a beer, and that beer didn’t have a home. I think people lost faith in craft beer for a little while. But the strong breweries like Goose Island, Widmer, Deschutes, and Sierra Nevada stayed in there and plowed through that bad time. Here we are, and I fear—a little bit—that we are kind of approaching another one of these times.

However, it’s different because most of these new brands are actual breweries with real people behind the beers. I think there is a lot more authenticity to the craft beer world now then there was in the late 1990s.

<strong>EM:</strong> So let’s move back and forward again. In 2000, right around when this first bubble was bursting, you split Chicago and went to California, right?

<strong>MB:</strong> Right.

<strong>EM:</strong> What happened there, those guys just picked you up?

<strong>MB:</strong> Yeah, I actually got headhunted. I wasn’t looking for a job, but the phone rang one day and said, “Hey, you wanna come to California?” I’d always considered California to be the Big League of craft brewing.

But actually I went out to the West Coast and I realized that Goose Island really had it going on. I thought I was going to the Promised Land, but really there wasn’t a whole lot more going on out there. The only good thing is that there were a lot of wonderful new brewers to interface with so I learned new techniques, saw different things.

So that was a huge move for me professionally and, to be honest with you, the impetus was to have creative control. Greg was super creative and I learned a lot at the time, but I was always going to be Greg’s brewer. I was kind of young and crazy and ready; I felt I had to take a chance and move.

So yes, I was recruited. I got picked up by Slow Brewing Company.

<strong>EM:</strong> I don’t even know who they are.

<strong>MB:</strong> Yeah, exactly. And I should have done my homework. So they offered me too-good-to-be-true deal, and it turned out to be that way. They weren’t financially well-off, and as it turned out hiring me and bringing me on was kind of their last try. They had been looking at Goose and thought that if they could make beers like that, they could rule the world—so they hired one of the Goose brewers.

<strong>EM:</strong> But they needed more than that.

<strong>MB:</strong> Right. They had already done enough damage to their brand, and I was young enough to believe I could actually fix the brand with good beer. So one lesson I learned is that once you’ve done damage to a brand, it’s game over. Within a year that brewery collapsed, and I thought I was out of a job.

But another opportunity came up. When Slow Brewery failed I came back here to Chicago, to work with Bill Jacobs and install the brewery at Piece. Then I hired another Goose Island alum, Jonathan Cutler, to run the system. And then I got this phone call from Firestone Vineyards. “Hey, we’re gonna buy the Slow Brewery space and we want you to come back to California to run it for us.”

<strong>EM:</strong> So what happened? You must have had a crisis right there.

<strong>MB</strong>: Well it was evident, while I was working for Slow Brew before, that something was gonna go down. And before I left California we had already written the business plan for Piece, and I told them that I wouldn’t be the day-to-day grind shift brewer, but I would get it up and running and find a really good brewer. Jonathan is probably one of the most overqualified pub brewers (out there other than Jim Cibak!). He worked at Goose as a packaging manager, went out to Sierra and ran filtration for a while, and he then came back to be a pub brewer at Piece, to be closer to his family, and get some creative control. And he’s done an incredible job.

I’m still really close with him and Bill Jacobs, and the people at Piece, and Piece just celebrated their tenth anniversary this year—it’s a milestone.

<strong>EM</strong>: So, wait, can you explain the Firestone Walker Slow Brewery thing?

<strong>MB</strong>: Yeah, so basically Firestone is a wine family. And my boss Adam Firestone’s great-grandfather was the one who started Firestone Tires. And then they sold that company—I don’t remember the exact year, but in the 1970s—and over the course of time, they sold all their shares of the business and the different family members went off to do other things.

Adam’s father started a winery, called Firestone Vineyards, in Santa Barbara County. So Adam was running that company and his brother, David Walker, was in the tech business. Those two decided to do this brewery as a side project, because they had access to equipment and real estate there in Santa Barbara.

Firestone is just an old building on the vineyard property. They never expected it to grow, but the beer really took off in the Central Coast—I mean, Firestone is to the central coast what Goose is to Chicago. And their project from day one was to do barrel-fermented ales—not barrel-aged, but barrel-fermented which, as it turns out, is very closely linked to the English Burton Union brewing system. One hundred and fifty years ago, state-of-the-art fermentation science was basically brewing beer in barrels. And when Firestone opened up in 1996, it was one of only two places in the whole world still doing that—the other is Marstons in Burton-Upon-Trent.

And when they called me, Firestone had exhausted the capacity of their original brewery—that’s why they bought the Slow Brewing Co., to expand. A kind of the perfect end to that story is that this past year Adam and David brought me onboard as a partner at Firestone Walker.

<strong>EM</strong>: Do you know how fucking generous and beautiful that is? What a bunch of great guys.

<strong>MB</strong>: Yeah, it says a lot about them. But it’s also great model for other successful breweries—I call it Golden Handcuffs, when you are able to tie some of your key people to the company. It’s great for longevity, quality control, all the right reasons. So that’s a really cool end to the story.

<strong>EM</strong>: There are a lot of new breweries starting, and it seems like their intentions are coming from two directions. There are these dreamers who love beer and are making home brew and want to make their liquid dreams come true. And then there’s a bubble market mentally, the sentiment that this is a great way to cash in. Those guys are making shitty beer.

<strong>MB</strong>: Well I mean, inevitably is going to happen. But I think most of that plays out. One or two gems are going to survive, and that’s going to help the industry. The Brewers Association said last year was a record year for start-ups. They had something like seven hundred start-ups! That’s a lot of breweries.

<strong>EM</strong>: But don’t you think every neighborhood in an urban area should have a brewery?

<strong>MB</strong>: I think . . . brew pubs, yeah. Proliferation of brew pubs means there will be fresh beer, it’s local. People always ask me what my favorite beer is and I’m like, “Whatever the freshest beer is wherever I happen to be at that point in time—that’s my favorite beer.”

<strong>EM</strong>: What kind of advice would you give to people who want to start a brewery?

<strong>MB</strong>: I would say you should go to Siebel if you can. Get some education. Or, spend some time in other people’s breweries and really learn one-on-one. I always say it’s like art, or it’s like music: start with the classics. If you can do a clean pale ale or a really clean lager beer and start building on that, you will have a good start.

I don’t know if coming out of the gates making a triple wet-hopped Imperial Russian rye beer or whatever is a good idea. Those are fun and fanciful, but if you can really prove yourself as a brewer who can do the classics then that’s the right place to be. It’s like, you know, play some blues and then you can get into Radiohead-esque stuff later.

Practice makes perfect, and I think most of the best brewers have spent a lot of time just really trying to work out beers, one after another. However some of the best beers I’ve had recently are completely out of nowhere. There’s a little nano brewery in the UK called Kernal, they probably have a two-barrel system. And he’s hand-filling all the bottles, it’s all bottle conditioned. It’s some of the best beer I’ve ever had.

<strong>EM</strong>: What other advice do you have?

<strong>MB</strong>: Well, I think there’s so much information out there right now. Back when I was home-brewing, there was not much access to equipment and only a few books. Today there are so many rich resources. There’s never been a better time to become a brewer and learn. And right here in Chicago you’ve got Randy Mosher and Ray Daniels, you’ve got Siebel—tap your local resources first and foremost.

When I was home-brewing, I guess I always had this idea that if I was going to do it, I was going to go at it one hundred percent and learn everything there was. I’d come home from my brewing job and read brewing books. So, really: just soak up all the knowledge out there like you’re a sponge.

<strong>EM</strong>: Thanks, man.

<strong>MB</strong>: No problem.
