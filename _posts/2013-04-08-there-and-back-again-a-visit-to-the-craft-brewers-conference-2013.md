Some readers of <em>Mash Tun Journal</em> might know that we are building our own brewery here in Chicago.  So in late March I  went to the annual <a href="http://www.craftbrewersconference.com/">Craft Brewers Conference</a> in Washington DC  to see how the revolution in craft brewing looks in person. By taking a snapshot at some of the trends and fads currently in the industry I hoped to come back better armed with insight and guidance as I embark with my brothers and our friends on our collective liquid dreams.<em>   <em>[ Disclaimer: All crappy photos in this post were taken with my Iphone ]</em></em>

&nbsp;

The conference took place in the lovely Washington Convention Center taking over the main exhibition hall and dozens of conference rooms that featured seminars on everything from: Writing your own Brewery Business Plan;  to Surviving the Bubble: Analytics for Strategic Decisions, to Brewing with Wood. I  went to a few of the sessions for Start Ups. For newbs and recently inspired brewery entrepreneurs, these panels were helpful in giving some basic facts and structural advice. It was nice to hear from brewery owners regarding return on investment formulas and warnings of hidden costs. It was also good to remember that new breweries are going to have a hard time buying simco, citra and mosaic hops.  But for the most part the couple of Start Up panels I attended seemed rather pedestrian and imparted some low level info. If you are starting a brewery my suggestion is that you talk to a brewery owner. Or talk to super pros in the industry, like <em>Mash Tun</em> contributor and Master Cicerone, Dave Kahle. This is one of the best reasons for putting out our <em>Mash Tun Journal</em>. We get to talk to these amazing guys. And I know you'll glean more information having a one hour conversation with them than by going to a Start Up seminar.  But then again our endeavor is no longer a brewery in planning. We are about to make some beer. So perhaps I should have gone to other panel tracks. Which I did.

&nbsp;

In between sessions I visited the Trade Show which featured over 400 vendors and businesses. The $400-600 price of admission was probably worth  just this facet of the Craft Brewers Conference. It is important to meet the people that make the equipment that help you brew beer and talk to the people that sell you the raw materials. I systematically went through the hall and met some of our current and perhaps future vendors.  For a brewer there is nothing more exciting than seeing piles of hops strewn all over the tables and floors of a convention center (unless you have a stainless steel fetish, and if you do, you will have a field day here). The one big thing I noticed  about this year's trade show is that it was a huge opportunity for many vendors to drum up some new business. To date there are 2,347 breweries in operation. 409 of them just opened in 2012. And there are about 1300 of them in planning mode right now. Most of the businesses at the trade show are going to make some nice coin re-selling tanks made in China and hops grown in the great northwest. And I am certain hundreds of hoppy-eyed dreamers were trying to figure out where they were going to spend their imaginary investment capital while walking the aisles of the trade show drinking free beers and stuffing schwag in their bags.

&nbsp;

On a side note, the Made in China quip is an interesting facet of the craft brewing business. I love the fact that making craft beer creates American jobs ( over 108,000 in fact!). But unless you have been sleeping for the past twenty years, you must know that China makes almost everything we use in manufacturing. And the same holds true for the brewing universe. Tanks are made in China. Brewhouses are made in China. Glassware is made there, too.  I asked many vendors about this China thing and they pointed to labor and material costs.  Some talked about a deficit in skilled labor to do all that welding and forming. I shrugged.  I do know that the quality of equipment made in China varies, and you have to ask around to figure out which vendors have shitty gear. I also know that most of the big stainless is tricked out and assembled here in the States by a few companies.  I saw one shit head vendor at the show who was touting that their tanks were dedicated to American Veterans and that if you purchased from them you would be supporting the troops. They of course failed to disclose that their tanks were not made in the USA. Also at the show were some Canadian, German and Czech manufacturers that make good equipment, albeit at a higher cost. Everyone knows that "You get what you pay for." So if you are a capital strapped cholo and you want to save a few thousand bucks buying a hybrid Chinese/ US manufactured product, go for it.

&nbsp;

For nano brewery guys the most interesting booths were probably those featuring small brewhouse and test batch systems. If you are undercapitalized you may want to start small and check these guys out: Sabco has been selling their <a href="https://brewmagic.com/">Brewmagic</a> 1/2 barrel system (6K) since the late 90s and they work pretty well from what I have heard from the peanut gallery. Many a retired brewer has one of these in their garage. At their booth the Sabco guys were touting a new two barrel system they just developed called Nano Magic. It comes complete with fermentation tanks and other gear for about 55K. If that is too steep a price tag then you might want to go with a More Beer! Braumeister system. They are all electric and come in two barrel and four barrel configurations costing between 16K and 36K respectively, but without tanks. We have already purchased a four barrel system from <a href="http://www.psychobrewllc.com/">Psycho Brew</a>, a couple of guys who make steel in Michigan and it cost us about 15K. Our friends at <a href="http://www.pipeworksbrewing.net/">Pipeworks Brewery</a> started on one of these and come highly recommended. We just installed ours and are just about ready to brew.

I went to some other conference sessions about Selling Craft Beer and they were eye opening. I was enlightened by various statistics and figures and was particularly enthralled by the data presented by Guest Metrics. Some random facts gleaned from my notes:
• Craft beer is now available in over 50% of On Premise accounts. That means that over half of all the bars and restaurants in the country are serving the good stuff.
• The top craft beer styles are IPA, Seasonals and Pale Ales. Not a surprise.
• 13.2 million barrels of beer were sold in 2012, a 15% increase from 2011.
•  The average case price of craft beer  to a retailer is  $33.21. ( for 12 oz bottles and cans)
• The average brewery makes 500 barrels of beer a year.
• Exports of craft beer have grown to 190,000 barrels ( mostly to Canada)
• The top five states for new brewery openings are: 1. California, 2. Colorado, 3. Texas, 4. Washington, and 5. Michigan.
• In general the most gains in the retail market are beers that cost over $6/ glass.

&nbsp;

But here is the most interesting stuff about the craft beer industry:
There are almost 2,600 craft brands in the US. This is a 24% increase from last year. And of these 2,600 breweries the largest 204 brands sell almost 80% of ALL the craft beer!  And just fifteen of these craft brands sell almost 50% of all the craft beer by volume! That is pretty insane. That means the remaining 2,143 breweries COMBINED only sell 20% of all the craft beer made in America. When I heard these figures I freaked. But then I calmed down. According to an analyst and economist from Brooklyn Brewery, the majority of growth in the craft beer market, where predictions keep calling of a 15% growth rate per year, is coming from these 2,243 + breweries. The little guys are gaining high rates of growth while the top 204 are competing for 1-3% growth a year. And that made me think that maybe our little brewery has a chance if we make high quality beer and do a good job selling it.

&nbsp;

I was sitting on some couches taking a break between presentations and these two guys pulled up next to me and started an impromptu interview.  I eavesdropped on them and  I heard the founder of a regional brewery talk about how unrealistic and naive many of the attendees were at this year's conference. He also noted those insane statistics that I mentioned above and warned of shelf space battles and quality issues from the next generation of breweries coming down the line. After I heard him say, "Everyone thinks they are gonna be the next Sierra Nevada," I interrupted. I said, "I don't want to be the next Sierra Nevada and I don't think most of the people coming to the conference do. I told him I just want to make great beer for my community. I also mentioned that although the craft beer segment was getting crowded and he had to keep in mind that most of the growth was coming from the small guys, these nano guys.  He mentioned that was true, but it was important for the small guys to know what they want to get out of brewing. You gotta have realistic goals. If you are getting into brewing and want to make it rich, you are in the wrong game. He indicated that mid-sized and regional breweries have small margins. So if these new brewery start ups  want to simply pay their bills and give themselves a salary that they would probably do just fine. We talked a bit more about how important the quality of beer should be and that you can't just make "good" beer, you have to make "great" beer or get all lost in the super market. I agreed. Super cool guy.

&nbsp;

The last session I attended was called Eclipse: Big Brand, Tiny Brewery  by the hot shit <a href="http://www.fiftyfiftybrewing.com/?pg=eclipse">50/50 Brewing Company</a> out of Truckee Nevada. And they were fantastic. They served beer to all the attendees of their panel and were pretty honest and forthright about how they started and what their schtick was. The husband and wife team gave a nice powerpoint where they explained how they do everything from janitorial duties to brewing and did a walk through of their strategy. 50/50 uses an 8 1/2 barrel system tucked into a 900 sq ft facility and they make about 900 barrels a year. They suggested to the start uppers in attendance that they forgoe raising major investor money and use their own cash, like they did. They emphasized the importance of hiring a great brewer who has technical skills and vision. And the rest of the their plan was pretty simple. They chose to do a simple high quality brand that had a high margin of profitability. And it worked. These are guys who make the Eclipse beers, those $30 bomber bottles of barrel aged Russian Imperial Stouts which are highly regarded and praised in the beer geek community. The beer is a very small batch, and the bottles are wax dipped and hand assembled. The thing that gave them national notoriety was the fact they used 23 year old Pappy Van Winkle barrels in their first batch. After that they started branching out and each year they create batches from 4-7 different brands of whiskeys  to impart their beers with the different characteristics. Beer geeks love it and often purchase the entire series. Another interesting facet of their plan was the idea of selling futures. Customers are able to rep-order batches of the Eclipse series and this up front cash gives the brewery enough operating capital while the beer ages for six months. I really liked these guys and they helped affirm my belief in good branding and aesthetics and share a commitment to making awesome beers.

&nbsp;

The last day of the conference was pretty hazy for most. After a few days and nights of tap takeovers, drinking, meetings, seminars and schmoozing you could tell most people were pooped out. Upon the recommendation of my buddy, Lincoln Anderson, we went to Nandos for some African fast food. It was awesome, like most of the food we had while in town (we ate at <a href="http://tokiunderground.com/#/">Toki Underground</a>, <a href="http://www.rasikarestaurant.com/">Rasika</a>, and even Teaism ). As I sat there devouring a second plate of spicy chicken, I went over my experiences  that week and it validated decisions we have made for our brewery. I know that we have a long way to go, but I also know we are on the right track. While hanging out with 6000 + of the worlds craft beer cognoscenti  I felt part of the excitement, camaraderie and enthusiasm that makes the craft beer world such a seductive and beautiful place to be. If you need something to crush your doubts about taking part in the draft beer movement, you should attend the conference next year. It will only help all you liquid dreamers and adventure capitalists out there.
