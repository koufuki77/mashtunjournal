The third edition of the Mash Tun Festival will take place June 22, 2013 in neighborhood of Bridgeport, the Community of the Future.  The festival features some of the world’s best breweries . Flagship and rare beers will be poured alongside one-of-a-kind concoctions at the stunning Bridgeport Art Center at 35th and Racine. The festival will be held in the 19th century loading dock and the center’s sculpture garden.

The festival is a celebration of the release of <em><a href="http://www.mashtunfest.org">Mash Tun: A Craft Beer Journal </a></em>issue #3. The <em>Mash Tun</em> is a publication put out by your buddies at <a href="http://www.community-bar.com">Maria’s Packaged Goods &amp; Community Bar</a> and <a href="http://www.publicmediainstitute.com">The Public Media Institute,</a> a non profit arts and culture organization based in Bridgeport.  <em>Mash Tun</em> is our paean to craft beer. It follows the pleasures and aesthetics of craft beer and how it intersects with food, culture, and society.

We are hosting an awards ceremony this year. Mash Tun will be giving out at least four awards to brewers that make the best beer in these categories:

Hopped and Confused
The Bold and Beautiful
Every Day is Like Sunday ( session beer)
WTF Is This (experimental)

Participating breweries and beers to be poured will be announced in May. Tickets will go on Sale in May.
