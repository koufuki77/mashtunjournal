<em><strong>December 10th •  7-11pm • Free! •  21+</strong></em>
<em><strong>Co-Prosperity Sphere • 3219 S Morgan St</strong></em>

Join Mash Tun and the Beer Temple’s Insider’s Roundtable for the release of issue 8 of Mash Tun Journal. We will be hosting a bottle share and producing a live studio broadcast and taping of the Insider’s Roundtable show.

Special guests include brewers featured in the brand spanking new issue # 8  of Mash Tun Journal.

We will supply some of the beers made by the brewers and breweries featured.
It’s a bottle share! Bring some! And please wear your ugly holiday sweater.

This is a Mash Tun Society event. Please RSVP at ed@mashtunjournal.org. So we can make sure we have enough vittles..
