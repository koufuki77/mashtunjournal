From the shores of Chicago’s only naturally fermenting river rises a homebrew contest and event unlike any other. A keg vs. keg faceoff for the ultimate prize: brew the winning beer with Pete Crowley at Haymarket Pub

It’s also your chance to taste and rate each beer entered in the contest and choose one winner. You’ll receive an official scorecard and a souvenir tasting glass. Plus, you can learn more about judging and find out how to become a judge from HOPS! members and BJCP judges.

Several prizes will be awarded. The Best Of Show Award will be selected by BJCP judges. One winner will brew his or her recipe with Pete Crowley.

The People’s Choice Award will be chosen by popular vote. The winner will receive a $200 gift certificate, with 2nd and 3rd place winning Haymarket gift cards. To have the opportunity to be a judge, sample Chicago’s best homebrew and be a part of the first-ever Barrel Brawl, visit <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/230671" rel="nofollow">http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/230671</a>
