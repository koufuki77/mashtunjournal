Join us Sunday, April 7th from 1-4pm at the Marz taproom and kitchen for the release of issue #13 of <em>Mash Tun Journal</em>. It is guest edited along with Miguel Rivas, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebeertrekker/?hl=en"><em>the Beer Trekker</em></a>.

This issue features guides to some breweries and beer bars around the world as well as artist Jacob Ciocci’s essay about the hazy beer craze, “Why Can’t I taste Beer Online yet?”.
