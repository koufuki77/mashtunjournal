“Beer festival.” The description sounds innocent and pleasant enough, even to those who may never touch a malted beverage to their lips. It evokes iconic images of steins hoisted aloft, oom-pah music, waitresses in drindls serving copious amounts of märzen (and often displaying equally copious amounts of cleavage), and generally lager-soaked, Bavarian frivolity.

Or one might picture a gathering of many bearded, ironic t-shirt-wearing obsessives, holding small sampling glassware to their nostrils, then inhaling slowly and pausing, eyes closed, before taking a delicate sip. Then they pause again and repeat this process over and over, throughout the day or night, until the each item on the list of obscurities has been crossed off.

In either case, and while they are first and foremost leisure events, beer festivals also serve as major tests of endurance, where danger awaits the ill-prepared. As a result, the appropriate steps must be followed in order to safely participate in and maximize enjoyment. The preparation or experience is not all that different from what a marathon runner might do before, during, and after her 26.2 mile trek (stay hydrated, try to make it to the end), combined with the challenges a truck driver faces, hauling a rig across great swaths of the country (just hang in there a little bit longer, and hope there’s not a long line when you get to the rest room). Let’s face it: whether it’s because of brews made in locales you haven’t visited yet, or your favorite brewery’s new barleywine, infused with saffron and aged in Chilean pisco barrels just for the event, attending a beer festival means consuming numerous servings of many different beers you otherwise may never have an opportunity to enjoy. It must be done, but it must be done responsibly.

Whether you have yet to attend your first beer festival or are an experienced veteran, the following tips will help you make the most of your festival (as well as the day after it) and practice responsible binge drinking.

&nbsp;

<strong><em>1. Get Adequate Rest</em></strong>

Your mom’s advice applies here: a good night’s (or afternoon’s) rest before the fest is imperative. The combination of standing, crowd navigating, and of course, beer consumption will make you weary. You must take preventative measures to be at your most alert, lest you be overtaken by fatigue, head home early, and fail to take advantage of the full hours of the festival (which is number three on a different list, Top Ten Beer Festival Sins).

&nbsp;

<strong><em>2. Build a Solid Food Base</em></strong>

The importance of establishing an impenetrable foundation of food in your stomach, in the ninety minutes leading up to the festival’s first pour, cannot be overstated. A rich mixture of carb-, cheese-, and grease-laden food will make a strong barrier between the high gravity beers you are about to ingest and your bloodstream. Pizza, especially but not exclusively the deep dish variety, consistently does the job in this respect. Should pizza be unavailable, try a large bowl of pasta: heavy on the sauce, easy on the meat. If your festival is starting earlier in the day, a great big helping of pancakes can also see you through. (Of course it is important to find the right balance. You don’t want to eat yourself into a coma before you even begin sampling the beers you have been anticipating since you bought your ticket weeks or months ago.)

<strong><em>3. Do Not Drink Before the Festival</em></strong>

This should be self-explanatory, but we’ll explore the argument behind it anyway. It may be difficult to fight off the pre-festival butterflies unleashed by the anticipation of the new, exotic beers you’re about to enjoy and that your friends will never have. Nerves can affect even the most seasoned festival goer, and what takes the edge off better than a beer? Or you might be following Tip Two, and stuffing your gut at an establishment with an intriguing beer selection. (This is especially challenging if you’re coming to the fest from out of town and surrounded by beers you can’t find at home.)  “It’s just one,” you tell yourself, “so it won’t really make a difference . . .”

Oh yes it will. That one seemingly harmless pre-fest beer you’re about to have is equal to three or four samples you’ll have during the festival. It seems like a good idea at the time, having that early beer, but in terms of variety, which is the major attraction of attending a beer festival, it’s an extremely lopsided trade. Plus, there’s a good chance you can find a bottle of that beer in a local store anyway. And in terms of maintaining sobriety, what are you trying to do to yourself? Especially if samplings are not limited (i.e., no coupons or tokens are exchanged for each taste), save yourself some money and put off your decadence a few minutes longer, you’ll appreciate the first taste in the festival that much more once you get it.

&nbsp;

<strong><em>4. Wear Shoes Appropriate for the Occasion</em></strong>

A beer festival is the last place to debut your new designer footwear. Not just because they are liable to be trampled on while you’re weaving your way through crowds from one serving area to another, but you and your fellow attendees will likely spill some of your prized samplings on them too. (And let’s not even think about what could happen if you venture too close to a dump bucket or a poorly maintained Port-a-John.)

Not only do you want to take care of your shoes, you’ll also want to take care of your feet and joints. These events tend to take place in locations that are convenient, available, and affordable, so the comfort of attendees is a secondary consideration, if it’s one at all. And many events are held in parking lots or storage areas, where the surface is unforgiving. You will be on your feet for the duration of the event (at least four or five hours), so if your festival is in such a location, make sure to wear some comfortable tennis shoes, gel inserts, or whatever works for you.

Sandals and open-toed footwear are generally discouraged, but if you are fortunate enough to attend a beer festival in a park, these forms of footwear are acceptable, even encouraged, in warm weather. However, if you think about the frothy mix of spilled beer, water fountain runoff, and Port-a-John secretions that you are likely to come into contact with, the same general rule applies—so don’t wear anything you intend to wear indoors again.

<strong><em>5. Bring a Pencil</em></strong>

This tool is very easy to forget, but obviously it’s essential if you want to thoroughly and objectively record your observations about each beer you sample. Or just use it to circle the beers you tried in the program and scribble your general impressions in shorthand that you might not understand later. (“Definitely more than triple-hopped.”)

&nbsp;

<strong><em>6. And An Accessory to Hold Your Sampling Glass</em></strong>

You’re going to let go of that thing sometime, aren’t you? You’ll have to if you have any intention of following Tip Five, eating any food during the fest, or visiting the lavatory. It might be tempting to think you can put your sampling glass in the pocket of your hoodie, but that won’t work if you hope to retain any liquid in it, and can lead to disaster if you hope to keep the glass itself as a souvenir—errant limbs or unusual body movements could easily dislodge or shatter it.

Fortunately, alternatives to your hands are available. The Beer Lanyard is commonly spotted at festivals near and far, and works well for vessels the size of sampling glasses. It’s available for purchase at brewcaddy.com. Observed at festivals less often, but perhaps offering additional safety and settings in which it can be used, is the Beer Holster, a tool that snaps to any standard belt.

&nbsp;

<strong><em>7. Consume Plentiful Amounts of Water</em></strong>

This should be a no-brainer, but when the focus is on imbibing all the unfamiliar liquids available to you, it is all too easy to lose track of that liquid which is the most familiar of all. The advice of legendary beer scribe Fred Eckhardt comes to mind. His DIY recipe for lite beer involves nothing more than drinking water before and after servings of craft beers, giving the drinker “all of the benefits of light beer and none of the negatives.” This advice is beneficial whether you’re at a beer festival or just enjoying another night at your local old man’s bar, and has the secondary benefit of slightly refreshing your palate.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>8. Get More Food During the Festival</strong></em>

See Tip Two. Even if it was well-constructed, you’ll need to fortify the food base you built earlier, at some point during the fest. If the organizers are responsible and conscientious, they will provide something complimentary for the attendees. But even if there’s no free food to nosh, it doesn’t mean the organizers are jerks—it could be a venue issue, or maybe the festival is just too large to make it practical to offer free food. But that still doesn’t mean you should go without eating—do not hesitate to lay down whatever amount of money is necessary to obtain adequate sustenance so you can make it through the remainder of the fest happily and still be a hero the next morning when you wake up earlier and feeling better than anyone expects you to.

<em><strong>9. Expect Palate Fatigue</strong></em>

If you’re sampling this many different brews, especially if they span more than one sector of the style spectrum (and definitely if sour or wild beers are involved), be forewarned that palate fatigue is an inevitable consequence. Your poor tongue can only handle so many different sensations! You can mitigate this somewhat with Tips Seven and Eight, but you will have to accept the fact that your palate will most likely call it a night before the rest of your body is ready.

&nbsp;

<strong><em>10. Finish Up with Plain Carbs and Water</em></strong>

You’ve reached the point where the taps and bungholes have been closed, security is clearing the crowd (or the brewers are fighting hard against their nature and trying their best to turn people away), and you’re attempting to figure out where to go and what to do next. If you made the most of the four or five hours the festival was operating, you are probably best advised to wind things down, though not necessarily immediately. First you’ll need to take in even more water, accompanied by simple carbs in their plainest, most unadulterated form: pretzels (soft or crunchy) or bread. These should help you sleep soundly through the night and also provide you with a head start for the next day. Including cheese or meats may be tempting, but may also be a recipe for disaster when added on top of the craft brew stew still settling in your stomach. Chugging a bottle of a sports performance beverage shortly before bed has also been found, in my mostly unscientific studies, to aid in recovery the next morning.

&nbsp;

May these tips improve your next beer festival experience, or at least make your next binge-drinking experience more responsible than your last one.
