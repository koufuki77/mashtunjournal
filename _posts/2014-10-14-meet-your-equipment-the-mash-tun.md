<em>Meet The Mash Tun - from Issue #5
</em>

<em>By Dave Kahle</em>

If you’ve ever been on a brewery tour, the guide rarely gives you much detail about the brewing equipment – and rightfully so, as most people just want to get to the tasting room at the end. Most of us look at all of this brewing equipment in wonder. It has a magical feeling about it. How do all of these intimidating, giant pieces of metal, with a labyrinth of pipes and hoses connected to them, produce this simple pleasure in a glass? While I don’t want to downplay the well thought out engineering of a modern brewhouse, there’s no reason to look at a brewery as if it’s a NASA testing facility. That being said, this article is the first in a series meant to introduce pieces of brewing equipment, remove some of the mystique, provide detail as to why it’s constructed the way it is and what it’s real purpose is. This won’t make the brewing process any less magical, it will hopefully reveal some of the thought process a brewer must consider in crafting a beer, and why they could be looked at more as artistic laborers than magicians.

&nbsp;

The mash tun is the first vessel used in a commercial brewery. The goal of mashing is to solubilize malt constituents, primarily extracting fermentable sugars, and dextrins (non-fermentable sugars) from malt. This is done by steeping the malt/grains in hot water. The mash tun is typically a stainless steel vessel, although copper is occasionally used. Copper is a good heat conductor and is malleable, but stainless is much easier to clean and maintain. Following the malt mill, crushed grain is sent to the mash tun. This is generally done with an auger inside of a tube that pushes grain up to a premasher fixed above the mash tun. In this premash mixer the grains are blended with hot water before falling into the mash tun below. The flow rate of both water and grain can be controlled by standard water shut off valves or a knife gate for the incoming grain. Some small breweries use pre-milled grain and pour it by hand from bags into the tun while hot water is introduced directly. When malt and hot water are combined in the tun, it is called, mash. The amount of malt used is approximately 1.5 - 2.5 lbs per gallon. This equates to using ~1000 lbs of malt for a 15 barrel batch of beer. A barrel is 31 gallons and 15 barrels is a standard size for many small American craft breweries to brew at a time.

&nbsp;

The combination mash/lauter tun is cylindrical and outfitted with perforated plates set a few inches above the bottom. The plates act like a colander allowing the malt grain bed to float above the sugar water extract (now called wort). There is a set of rakes inside the tun that are turned by a motor mounted above the mash tun. These rakes, mixing both horizontally and vertically, move slowly through the mash breaking up any clumping of the grain, insuring an even temperature is maintained throughout and no hot spots or scorching occurs. Enzymes, which we’ll touch on in a bit, are also distributed more evenly with the rakes.

&nbsp;

The speed of the rakes is often controlled by a computer or control panel. If the rakes spin too fast they will spin all of the mash instead of simply mixing it evenly. Spinning the mash can cause oxygen to be introduced by creating a vortex. Oxygen is generally avoided as much as possible in the mash tun, since oxidative staling compounds can form that carry through to the finished beer, giving the beer stale off flavors. Small or traditional breweries will mix the mash by hand with a mash paddle, if they don’t have a rake system.

&nbsp;

Most mash tuns are heated by steam through tubes in a jacket that surrounds the vessel. Small breweries can mash with no integrated heat source, as long as the walls of the mash tun are well insulated. This usually means a few inches of insulation jacketing the tun. On rare occasion a brewery will have a direct-fired mash tun. The direct heat can cause an uneven temperature throughout the mash and scorching can occur. Managing the temperature of the mash is the most important variable for a brewer at this stage of the brewing process. In brewing, there are numerous enzymes at work. An enzyme is a chain of amino acids that acts as a catalyst for biochemical reactions. The tricky part of dealing with enzymes is they are temperature sensitive and whether they work quickly or become inactive can be a matter of just a few degrees.

&nbsp;

The key enzymes in the mash are proteases, which break down proteins, and amylases, which break down carbohydrates into smaller sugars. Brewers control the ratio of fermentable to non-fermentable sugars by setting the temperature of the mash. If the mash temp is in the 140-150F range, Beta Amylase is active, the activity rate increasing with the temperature. Beta Amylase breaks carbs into maltose, which is the most abundant sugar in wort, and is highly fermentable. If a brewer mashed at a temp favorable to Beta Amylase, the finished beer would have less body, a drier mouth-feel, and more alcohol. Alpha Amylase is active in the 148-159F range. Alpha Amylase breaks carbs into slightly longer chain sugars (dextrins) that are generally unfermentable by brewers yeast. However, these dextrins are now easier to break down further by Beta Amylase. If the brewer chooses a temperature that favors Alpha Amylase, the finished beer would have more body, more sweetness, and lower alcohol levels for the amount of grain used.

&nbsp;

In a large brewery, the mash tun is not the point at which grains are separated from the wort. The mash is pumped to a second vessel called the Lauter Tun, in which the wort is separated from grains, the grains are rinsed to extract more of the sugars and pumped to either a holding tank, or into the brew kettle. In a small or mid sized brewery, the mashing and lautering are often done in the same vessel. With this setup, the grain bed becomes a filter of sorts, as wort is drawn off below the perforated plates and hot sparge (rinse) water is sprayed over the top of the grain, rinsing out more sugars along way. After lautering, sparging, and pumping all of the wort to the brew kettle, the spent grains are either shoveled out of the tun, or pushed out with a grain-out plow. The grain is removed through a door set at the height of the perforated plates. Spent grains are typically given or sold to farmers to feed cattle. This arrangement is ideal for brewers, as thousands of pounds of grain take up a large amount of dumpster space.

&nbsp;

After the grains are removed, cleaning begins. Typically, a CIP (cleaning in place) protocol entails spraying hot water, with a percentage of caustic solution, through slots in ball shaped CIP heads. These spray balls spin ensuring the cleaning solution hits all parts of the interior of the mash tun. There is another series of spray heads set underneath the false bottom that sprays the cleaning solution upward through the perforations in the plates. This pushes out any grains or husk material that might've fallen below.

&nbsp;

A mash tun serves a relatively simple function, steeping grains in hot water. The tun is outfitted for ease of use, speed, and a largely self-cleaning ability. However it handles a critical point in the brewing process. The brewer must control temperature, water chemistry, ph, oxygen uptake, and flow rates within the mash tun, or the finished beer could have wildly varying results. Consistency is extremely important in a commercial brewery, and it all starts with the Mash Tun.
