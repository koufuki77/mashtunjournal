We had a great time at our <a href="http://www.mashtunfest.org">Mash Tun Oktoberfest</a> party last October 5, 2012. It was held in conjunction with the the Bridgeport Block Party, a neighborhood wide arts happening that took place at the Zhou B Center, The Bridgeport Art Center and at our gallery the Co-Prosperity Sphere. We held the festival at the Bridgeport Art Center's Atrium which is a perfect place to have a party... Our friend and <em>Mash Tun</em> contributor, Michael Kiser, <a href="http://goodbeerhunting.com/blog/2012/10/15/the-2012-fall-mash-tun-fest-and-a-visit-from-se-kiser-a-ghost-of-chicago-beers-past">did a great recap of the event.</a> We hope you check his blog out.

We are sending issues of the journal all over the country. Hopefully you find it at your favorite place for good beer.
Expect to purchase them via our site or at <a href="http://www.quimbys.com">Quimbys</a> in Chicago. And Michael<a href="http://goodbeerhunting.bigcartel.com/"> has a shop</a> where he is selling them as well.

If you want to purchase copies wholesale, drop us a line.
