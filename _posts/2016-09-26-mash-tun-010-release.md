<em><strong> Sunday, Oct 9 - 2-6 PM</strong></em>
<em><strong> 960 W. 31st St, Chicago, IL. 60608</strong></em></span>

Sword Fight: A Sausage Battle Royale

Sword Fight is Kimski’s inaugural sausage competition. It’s a celebration of encased meats and the people who make and eat them. We will pit three of Chicago's premier purveyors of encased, cured and fresh meats; Publican Quality Meats, Haymarket Pub &amp; Brewery and Bridgeport's own Martinez Supermarket in a brat battle royale against one another with the audience ultimately deciding who the wiener is by voting for their favorite.

Sword Fight also features a Sausage Toss contest and a Relish Race.
<span class="text_exposed_show">
The Sausage Toss (like the well-known picnic balloon toss) will use casings filled with water with different players throwing the sausages to one another, taking a step back after each catch until one player either drops or pops his sausage.</span>

The Relish Race will be a three-member Olympic-like relay event with different runners handing off a sausage baton to one another as they run a circular course around Maria's. First team to the finish line without dropping their sausage wins.

The final competition will be a Polish -sausage eating contest, presided by the Sausage Queen, Nicole Makowski of Makowski Real Sausage Co.

Other treats include The Chicago Stock Yard Kilty Band and Carnival Style Sausage cutouts painted by our own Chef Won Kim.

We invite you to drop by to share in the festivities for this afternoon of good-natured fun, frivolity and great food.

We will be serving all three sausages as a sampler and a la carte. And of course, you'll be able to pair your sausage with Maria's varied and wide selection of draft beers and cocktails.
