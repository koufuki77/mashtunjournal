<strong>A Conversation with Tony Magee of Lagunitas Brewery
</strong><em> from issue <a href="http://underthecounterculture.bigcartel.com/product/mash-tun-journal-6">#6 of Mash Tun Journal</a></em> ( photos by Hank Pearl )<strong>
</strong>
<em>Ed Marszewski:</em> Let's start out with something like this: What's a typical day like for you, Tony?

Tony Magee: A typical day, well...  A typical day in 2014 is a very different day than a typical day in 2013, ’12, ’11, or ’10. I mean my job has never stopped changing and morphing radically, you know. The one thing that has always been essential is conversations like this, and it used to be that I would have conversations with one customer sort of like this, one day at a time, one customer at a time, one bar at a time, but now I do an interview and you know, it goes out on the internet and becomes a bit of a larger conversation. I talked to people through the labeling, through the branding. I write the stories through the bottle label and I design the labels from scratch on my little powerbook, just like that. And that's where all the labels come from. So 90% of my job has always been just trying to communicate the thing we do, and the other 10% is the kind of thing that can take up 90% of my time, you know?

E: Yeah. I sure do.

T: And that was just trying to hold the ship together, trying to hold it together financially, or from a raw material standpoint, or a supply standpoint, the relationships with distributors standpoint, it just never ends. Trying to hold the ship together, even today it's still the same. Now I am involved in this whole kind of crazy thing where another large brewer has decided to do a label that’s almost identical to ours. So this is a moment of trying to hold it all together, you know, and to keep the thing intact and safe. But in the past, I was trying to keep it safe from a predatory line of credit that we've been attached to. Or I was trying to keep it safe from the glass supplier to whom I owed a lot of money, and needed to keep him comfortable so we didn't impair all my employees or impair the company.

E: So in many ways a typical day today is very much like the beginning of when you started the brewery: it's your job to steward the company. You have to deal with the various day-to-day activities of running a business.

T: That's right. Another way to look at the same thing is that it's more abstract than the day-to-day of running a business. I often think to myself, there's a ghost in the machine. Kyle Young wrote about the person inside of the body. You cut off your leg and it's not going to change who you are. It might change what your body will do, but you are obviously by definition separate from that. So I'm the ghost in the machine at Lagunitas. I have always been that, and hope to always be that. As far as I know with the future of the business, I'm in the “die in payroll” plan, so to that extent I've got to remain that ghost within the business.

E: As you know we just started up our project, called Marz Community Brewing, and it really is like you are saying. I check our figures every week. I wonder to myself "are we going to bring in enough money to cover our costs for all the shit we're buying next week? And it's a constant circulation of funds. I call it the continuous cash flow system. It's like there is really no money, it just flows.

T: It just turns around and around.

E: It just turns around and it doesn't exist anywhere really.

T: And the truth is that at about 35,000 barrels that all changes.

E: You have to get to 35,000 barrels for it to change?!

T: Or you, see you are in a really nice spot right now where you are able to sell the beer for $8 or $9 for a bottle, so they're very special and people regard them as rare. But if the quantity of beer you make were to grow, then they are not quite as rare anymore and by definition a little bit of that special-ness is sort of ground off of it, and so the pricing has to change. So then you have to grow. There are these little step function things. Sometimes you're walking up the stairs and each step is the same size as the one before but then you get to one step that's a big step. And so if you step beyond, in my experience, beyond 5,000 barrels, things change until you get to about 35,000.

E: I was thinking that change came at 2,000 barrels.

T: Keep thinking that. It's something that will keep you going. For years and years and years I told my wife, three-to-five years honey, three-to-five years, trust me, trust me.

E: Yeah absolutely. Well you know that's funny. That's really funny.

T: But don't kid yourself, if you do well, if you do this right, 35,000 is not that far away.

E: You’ve gotta be kidding me.

T: It's a lot of decisions between here and there but consumer acceptance will carry you there. And then you'll have to ask yourself, do I want to make more beer to say thank you to the people who've said they love us? Or do I want to say no, we are going to stay rare and hard to find. And if you want to stay rare and hard to find that's a decision you can make but then your customers are going to say, "Oh well but, won't you make more? We'd like to drink more." So it's just a question you have to answer. There's no demand, there's no imperative, there's no ambition in it. For us, we came up at a time when a ten dollar 22 oz. bottle would have sat on the shelf. Ken Allen, the cool guy who founded Anderson Valley Brewing, told me he wanted to be the first ten dollar 22 oz. bottle of beer. You couldn't do it. Five dollars was as much as he dared charge for beer then. In that time, there were imperatives that drove you to scale. Then once you start into the scale game, then it's like being chased down the street by wild dogs. You just run as fast as you can to stay ahead of that bill that's coming in next week for the beer you made this week.

E: That's the thing. I realize that no matter what kind of forecasting I could do, no matter what kind of planning I made, it doesn't really matter. Murphy's law gets in the way. And the business plan is a living business plan that keeps evolving, right?

T: That's right.

E: Now, as the owner of your company you could say, well that’s just fucking life guys— this is the way it’s going to be. Like you've mentioned in the past, you don't have to deal with outside investors helping to determine what your business will be like in a sense.

T: Well I never answered to outside investors, but I answered to the economics of the business. And so now with craft beer being so much more ubiquitous than it was in the 90's, the ecological niche like this opened up. Well you can have a business built around very special, very unique, one off, hard to find, impossible, beers made with unobtainium that cost ten dollars a bottle, and you know there will be enough curious consumers that it is a business. That didn't exist back when we were young.

E: No, well you guys pioneered and created this kind of awareness of craft beer. Without you guys doing what you did we wouldn't even be here.

T: Us and a lot of others.

E: You mention people of that generation, brewers from the 80's and 90's.

T: Yeah we sold beer belly to belly, one pint at a time for years, and years, and years.

<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2015/08/the-big-dog-tony-magee/lagunitas_taproom/" rel="attachment wp-att-631"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-631" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lagunitas_taproom-550x368.jpg" alt="Lagunitas_taproom" width="550" height="368" /></a>

E: Well you guys brought the industry to the point where I look at a brewery as cultural development and economic development for a neighborhood. It's more than just beer. It helps rejuvenate a neighborhood. It provides jobs, provides manufacturing gigs in a country that's been depopulated of manufacturing jobs.

T: You know, there are social anthropologists that believe that fermented beverages, wine when you lived near fruit, or beer if you lived near grain, were the central organizing force behind the division of labor, which was the organizing principle for society. I mean you can imagine there was a tribe, a bunch of humans kind of hanging out, struggling to stay alive and suddenly somebody is able to kind of make this fermented beverage happen. And the biggest guys in the tribe who were able to catch bears more readily looked at the guy who made the beer and went, "Okay you make more of that shit, I'll be back, I'll share some bear when I get back home." And then there was division of labor. Somebody needed to collect the grains, someone else needed to tend to the fermentation, to keep the rats away, and then next thing you know you end up with a society and so when you talk about it being a community development, I mean...

E: Communities form from making beer!

T: It's never been any other way. The recognition that that's true is a powerful thing. I don't think we're really in the beer business, even Lagunitas at our large size. We're not in the beer business, we're in the tribe-building business.

E: Yeah, you're absolutely right. It’s about culture, it's about bringing people together. And you know what? That is exactly the experience we’ve had at this bar, Maria's Packaged Goods &amp; Community Bar, that my family runs.

T: I'll bet.

<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2015/08/the-big-dog-tony-magee/lagunitas_hey/" rel="attachment wp-att-636"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-636" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lagunitas_hey-550x411.jpg" alt="Lagunitas_hey" width="550" height="411" /></a>

E: I've been involved in the arts for 25 years, doing art shows, exhibitions, festivals, putting out publications, whatever. My mother has owned this place forever and it always served a community function for the neighborhood. Back then it was full of working-class guys, retirees, ex-gang bangers, and it became a place where they could hang out and feel safe. Maria always made them feel safe and comfortable. But there are a hundred bars like that in the neighborhood, your typical old school shot and beer joint. And then the economy changed in 2007, 2008 and the dynamics changed here drastically. Back in the day my mother used to sell more Miller products than the Jewel Foods located down the block. The economy started going south, and the business model changed for her. So My brother and I stepped in and made a bar we thought we would like to drink in that was missing in our neighborhood.

T: You know back in 1979, I went to IIT here over on 35th and State, and we would come over to Bridgeport to get a beer because you wouldn't drink over there. The neighborhoods with the projects were just too dangerous. We'd come over here and it was never like this. A few years ago a friend of mine and I came in and we played music with our backs right up against this post and it was a Bridgeport I'd never seen before.

E: And that culture existed here, we had no idea, even while doing our art programming just down the block. But the place became a hub for neighbors to organize events, projects, and engage in neighborhood activism. It's a tavern that truly serves as a place for community involvement, and that blows my mind.

T: And you know, that’s the founding principle behind Starbucks.

E: Oh yeah? That freaks the shit out of me. It's kind of incredible actually that a chain has that mission. So this experience led to us saying to ourselves, if serving good beer has this kind of impact then let's get more involved. And of course a lot of people started getting involved. And so we started a brewery. While we started this project we noticed even more breweries opened up, and then people starting saying that maybe there are too many breweries popping up in Chicago. Now I always kind of poo poo those comments. It's a different time and a completely different generation of people who care about quality liquid, about spirits or beer, or wine or soft drinks, coffee! Right? So what's beautiful to me is that you have a lot more local producers coming out with stuff. Maybe that stuff isn't as great as it could be, but you also have this kind of phenomena where people really do want to support those third places, local places like their local brewery, the brewpub, etc., right?

T: That's right, yeah. We are a company and have an advisory board. So they just give us ideas and we share it and we share our ideas with them, they give us our feedback. One of the guys on our board is the Chief Marketing Officer at Facebook.  His name is Gary Greggs— he’s a cool cat. And he is just a regular guy.

E: Come on. Just a regular guy?

T: He is really smart and he has found the highest perch in the world. I was talking with him at our last conversation about the notion of beer as the original social media, and in a heartbeat he got it. In a heartbeat he knew exactly what I was talking about. This might have become a tavern now. But you might have called it a pub, because it was a public house. It was where you went to get the news, learn about births, deaths, whole stories. Yeah, it was social media. Beer is still that same social media. There is also the quote from Robert Winberg, who called beer a good lubricant for social intercourse.

<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2015/08/the-big-dog-tony-magee/lagunitas_bottling/" rel="attachment wp-att-632"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-632" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lagunitas_bottling-550x736.jpg" alt="Lagunitas_bottling" width="550" height="736" /></a>

E: Well speaking about social media… at some point I saw you mention that you might start an incubator or accelerator for the development of breweries. It seems like it was similar to something done in the tech industry, where there is a mechanism in place to help fund and guide new businesses and entrepreneurs. Obviously there is crowdsourcing for breweries today and you see the them doing all kinds of experiments to raise money. There is also the development of places like Brew Hub where they are building huge contract brewing facilities. Three years ago when I was trying to realize our plan, I noticed many budding brewpreneurs were struggling with financing and finding places to contract beer. So I wanted to create this co-op brewing center where you had several different systems in place for various uses and stages of growth for smaller breweries. It would be linked to various brewing schools and ancillary industries. It could even become a training center. But in general it seemed like a way to help incubate homebrewers or help people incubate their liquid dreams.

T: I like the idea of incubating a homebrewer. You have them in a little pod, you feed them malt, put a little yeast on them from time to time.

E: Ha. But it seems like Chicago would be the ideal place to start this concept. You could work with Siebel, you could work with culinary institutes, and other aspects of the industry around here. We also have a lot of talented brewers that would probably be great instructors. I wondered what your thoughts were on this concept because I think it's the most beautiful thing ever to help people start and grow small businesses.

T: Yeah I did want to do that. The reason for it is as altruistic as it is selfish. That's when self-interest combines with opportunity and all of the sudden, great things happen for people on both sides of that. And so I recognize that the future of brewing is going to have a giant local component to it. I want to be local, I don't want to just act local. And I thought one of the ways we could do that was to make relationships with nano-brewers in different parts of the country. In the kind of Ayn Rand sort of way, it's like: okay, if I love something you also love, maybe you will also love me back. It would enhance our relationship with neighborhoods and communities. I think it is still a good idea, but the truth is, it's a very complicated thing to do it right and to do it in a way that's actually useful and productive. Then all of the sudden we just started growing so hard and so fast. You have to pick your battles carefully as you won't win them all. So one thing I did want to do was to continue to shepherd the Lagunitas thing for us, so I moved away from that concept. It doesn't mean we won't go back and do that down the road. But it's complicated to do because if you give someone money you'd have a little bit of ownership. And I don't want to control you, but do you feel comfortable with this? Your customers might think that you sold out. It just gets very complicated for people to do something like that.

E: Getting any investors seems to be a really hard thing to do. It's hard for people to get small business loans, it's hard for people to get financing.

T: So remember I told you my kettle was the same size as yours when I first started out. I didn't know snot about what I was doing and the last thing I wanted to do was start giving away my future at an early date. A lot of small breweries are kind of that way as well. So the conversations were kind of difficult because there wasn't enough understanding yet on the nano brewers side.

E: I imagine they don't have enough experience to understand what to do when it comes to creative financing.

T: Yeah, like some jack-ass in San Francisco, a member of the brewing guild there, tweeted something about Lagunitas becoming like a wolf. It's like, aw fuck that, come on. It's just so far from truth. If you succeed, does that mean that somehow your soul went away?

E: It's the same argument with bands, when the indie band gets big the original fans think they sold out.

T: I think Smashing Pumpkins still sound like a million bucks. I mean yeah, things change, that's part of growing up. But a human being is never the same. Are you no longer soulful because you're not 17 anymore, because you are 23 and now you’re jaded? It was just this guy in San francisco saying that but I can see how small brewers could feel that way.

E: But some of that could come from envy and jealousy. It's like Morrissey's song, "We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful," do you know Morrissey?

T: I do know Morrissey. I know Morrissey's drummer actually. But the thing, is there is something to that, you know? I don't want to say it had anything to do with jealousy, because that's taking too much credit for myself or holding people in too low esteem. But the truth of the matter is, when the understandings aren't in parity with each other, then there is misunderstanding— that's the problem. We were never jealous of big brewers, and I'm not jealous of big brewers now. I've gotta say in some ways I'm jealous of small brewers. That's part true. I've never thought about that one. But it's not about jealousy. It's about wanting to live up to what it is you've said you want to be.

E: Absolutely.

T: And when people trust you, you want to live up to that.

E: So would Lagunitas ever offer small business loans to any brewers in the future?

T: You know, even today every bit of cash that the business generates, and it generates a lot, ends up being spent back up into carrying inventory and receivables. You have your bill of sale as a cap ex, building future capacity. It’s astounding.

E: So you can't do that? You don't have time for that.

T: Well we don't have the money for it. This was the idea with the small guys, because to a small guy $10,000 makes a big difference. But down the road I don't see why we wouldn't want to do that. But for today, we are still sort of hand to mouth, it's a big hand to a big mouth, it's still hand to mouth, you know.

E: Yeah it's the continuous cash flow thing. There is not enough to siphon off to do stuff like that.

T: Yeah no, but maybe, down the road all things are possible.

E: Yeah I'd like to see your idea for an incubator happen. I think it would be beautiful.You should at least be on the board of something that's doing something similar.

T: Well if somebody else put it together I would be happy to step in. I'm kind of a bad leader for anything. I am on my own sort of leash. I carry my leash like this and lead myself forward, but you know.

E: So let’s talk about the fact that there was some concern by other breweries when you moved to Chicago. I was a champion of you guys coming here, expanding, and doing whatever you can do to spread good liquid to people, and I think a lot of people feel that way.

T: You know, right from the bottom we don't try to have 5 tap handles. I want to have one. A bar has 5 or 10 or 20. There's a lot of room. And if I was in every bar in Chicago I'm still not dominating the scene. There's so much opportunity.

E: People tend to forget that the amount of craft beer in comparison to large macro beer is pretty insignificant in the country/in our culture.

T: What is it, just under 9% of all the beer, 9 out of 100.

E: It's really not a big deal.

T: I just watched a barrel of Bourbon County Stout come in on a hand truck full of Bud Light.

E: That's right, at one of the biggest craft beer bars in Chicago. Isn't that pretty funny?

T: It's just nature, it's just nature.

<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2015/08/the-big-dog-tony-magee/lagunitas_stainless/" rel="attachment wp-att-633"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-633" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lagunitas_stainless-550x358.jpg" alt="Lagunitas_stainless" width="550" height="358" /></a>

E: So that's my immediate reaction to people who complain about larger craft breweries coming into our market. One of the things other people talk about is because big guys like Lagunitas can scale up so much, it affects everyone's pricing. The theory is that the so-called premium pricing of craft liquid is going down because the market expanded. How do you address that?

T: Well let me say this. I've never sold Lagunitas beer for more money than we sell it for right now. So when Lagunitas was at 2,500 barrels and we were kind of just into bottling, a 22 oz bottle was $2.49, a 6 pack at retail was $5.99.

E: Shut the F up. That was the max price?

T: That's where the day was. The idea that somehow because of our scale we are able to undermine things, it's just not even close to true. I’ve never sold our beer for more than we do now. Now it is true that in the current environment I like to be at the lower end of the high end— not to generate volume, but because, first off it's more than I've ever sold beer for anyway. And secondly I think there's something friendly about that. And if being friendly makes friends, does that mean that I'm making it harder for other people to sell at their prices?

E: No, not at all.

T: When you look at the craft beer industry right now, as far as I can tell, every little brewer is pretty much operating at capacity. Everybody's expanding that can. So does that mean that the demand for craft beer is exactly matched by the supply? I mean that's a one bazillion chance that those two numbers exactly match. The truth is that the demand for craft beer wildly exceeds the supply and this is why there are Blue Moons and Shock Tops and Redd’s Apple Ales and all the rest of those in the world. So for any craft brewer to be thinking that somehow bigger craft breweries are crowding them, it's myopic. They should, as we always have, look up and say 9 out 100 of beers sold in the US are craft beers. What we need to do is convert more consumers. We need to make more friends and open more doors and go after every god damn Shock Top handle you see, and go after every Blue Moon or Redd's Apple Ale, or any of those imitation crafts that you see. When we came up we never ever, ever, on principle competed with another craft. I remember one time we got a Anchor Steam handle and I myself told the guy to knock it the fuck off, because there was a Bud Light handle and a Budweiser handle and a Michelob handle and a Heineken handle right next to it. Undifferentiated commodity liquid. I said get one of those and this is what we still do now.

E: And that’s actually kind of like the way most brewers...

T: Well a lot of craft brewers these days are starting to see other craft brewers as their competitors.

E: You really think so?

T: Oh fuck yeah. These guys up at Ten Barrel Brewing. I mean everyone gets upset with me for talking about that, because they're such nice guys. Now I can tell you first hand, they are fucking rich nice guys.

E: Ten Barrel is based in little ole Bend, Oregon. Deschutes started there over 25 years ago and since then twenty other breweries opened up. They became a big deal brewery locally and then regionally.

T: They were doing quite well. But what did they do? They came into a market where there were a lot of beers being sold of the types that they would sell. They were good, they were smart, they probably made good beer, they were effective marketers, and they cleaved off a little chunk of that market for themselves. But I doubt they did it by going after Bud Light handles. And they cleaved off a little part of whatever growth there was in America that was caused by the breweries that preceded them, and they cleaved that off and they sold it for a big premium to Anheuser Busch. I mean if there isn't such a thing as a traitor, I don't know what there is.

E: Yeah. They suck.

T: I mean this, traitor. "It is just business," people tell me, "Tony put on your big boy pants."

E: But it's not just business.

T: And you know Goose Island here in Chicago. I think John Hall was 70 years old when he sold with them.

E: Yeah, he wanted to retire.

T: And I know first hand that he was at 80,000 barrels or so, he probably hadn't stashed away a lot of money.

E: Because of the continuous cash flow issue with running a brewery.

T: It's hard at those sizes. He is probably making a good living, but was he putting enough away for his retirement money? No, his retirement money in his 50's and 60's went into the brewery. So for him to do it is a different modus operandi all together.

E: I thought Ten Barrel was originally set up as a business play to be sold to A-B. I read that one of the founders was from a hedge fund background and saw this as a pay out.

<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2015/08/the-big-dog-tony-magee/lagunitas_tanks/" rel="attachment wp-att-634"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-634" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lagunitas_tanks-550x824.jpg" alt="Lagunitas_tanks" width="550" height="824" /></a>

T: Probably, this will be the undoing of this little bubble. There’s a lot of rich kids with wealthy families coming into the business. They say the easiest way to make a million dollars is invest 20 million at 5%, you know? And so you know, some of that is going to have a corrupting and dilutive effect on the good work of all the guys who created our history, all the other great California Breweries, Oregon breweries, and all the guys who started up around here since back then.

E: Well that's the thing: it's so hard to differentiate this bifurcation in the craft brewing arena. The public has a hard time differentiating Shock Top vs. Allagash, right?

T: And now they're going to have a hard time differentiating a Ten Barrel from Deschutes. And they are going to think it's all the same. And some of the stuff that's happening is a Trojan horse. Big brewers are trying to find a way in and they couldn't. They tried for a decade to undermine craft.

E: Through the distributor relationships.

T: Exactly, retail relationships. And they were unable to do that, because this is a consumer driven revolution. This is a bottom-up thing, they are not able to control, so now they’re going to try and do it with the trojan horses.

E: Do you think there are going to be more deals like this coming down the pipe?

T: I think so. The people that came into the craft business just to sell their brewery in four or five years. I mean there’s a lot of guys doing that. I could tell from talking to you, you’re interested in the community-building part of it. If someone came along and offered you a million dollars for your brewery right now, you would have to think about it, right? Because it's a million dollars and what other good things might one do with that? But you might also find yourself really torn, because of all of these filaments you've connected your community with. You will have to ask yourself, "Am I going to just turn this over or am I actually making a place for myself in my neighborhood?"

E: I would rather just give it to the employees. Well, I live here. I am going to be here for a long time and I can't completely undermine my existence.

T: So you’re on the “die in payroll” plan too? Cheers to that.

E: This might be a good time to ask you a question about advice for small breweries, people who are starting up. Sometimes you don't want to give advice to assholes that are in this for the wrong reason, right? But I'm just a newb. I think I know what's going on. I'm very observant. But lately I see breweries coming out with sometimes subpar liquid, the shittiest fucking branding, the crappiest marketing I've ever seen in my life, and because I'm an artist or designer I'm in tune to that stuff and I just get bummed out. So my natural inclination is that well, not everyone is supposed to have a successful business. Some will just fail. It's a miracle the failure rate is a lot lower in the brewing industry, than say, the restaurant industry. But I have no clue why this is the case.

T: Well because just like in 2006, anyone that bought a home was going to make money. It didn't matter how many you bought. I heard a good expression: when the tide goes out it's easy to tell who's skinny dipping. Some day it will come clear. Right now everyone looks smart because there is so much enthusiasm in what we do and there's a lot of enthusiasm, both on the brewers’ side as well as on the consumers’ side. None of it is evil, but things will happen. You said you asked advice for guys. I'd say come into this business for the right reasons because it’s a very expensive business to get into. There's an old saying, if something seems like a good idea, it might well be too late. If you are coming into it just for that reason now, maybe you are going to be one of the lucky ones, but I bet you the bell curve does what it does and you won't be one of the lucky ones. You may find yourself becoming a brewer which is not a bad thing, but come into it for the right reasons.

E: We asked a bunch of local brewers from the guild to give us their two cents on this advice question and someone brought up Sam Calgione's quote that there is going to be a bloodbath coming in the brewing industry.

T: Yeah, Sam would like to see a bloodbath.

E: So what do you think he meant by that? People interpret it differently.

T: I think he misspoke. I think he meant a lot of breweries are going to fail because there are too many coming in. He wasn't around, but we were around through the 90's. I remember walking my dog one time around 1999 and just in my head I counted 25 breweries that had closed in the last 5 years. And you know, what I was thinking about was the tragedy. Because who knows, closing the brewery might have cost them their marriage. It might have cost them their house. It might have cost them a lot of friendships. Who knows? There is nothing good about it. That may come again. And I think saying it's a bloodbath is overstating it a little bit but I think he wanted to say something dramatic.

E: Yeah. Well we have a 6 barrel system by Psychobrew. We can't make enough beer. Can't believe people actually want our beer so much. It makes me happy, validates what we are doing in a way. But sometimes I wish we had a 30 barrel system and could go bonkers. I know there no rational reason to do this yet. We should just grow as big as our demand is in whatever time it takes.

&nbsp;

T:  You know when you have to grow. If you can you will, but you shouldn't do it for the sake of growing, because you'll make bad decisions with regard to how to finance it, how to get to those next levels. You will accept money from places that might imperil the whole thing. I did all those things. I made all those mistakes, but...

E: What bad decision are you talking about?

T: Well here is the worst case that's public record. Magic Hat Brewing hired a fellow who was the CEO of Pyramid Brewing, he comes over and he wants to buy Pyramid to roll it into Magic Hat, it's going to be a big cross-coast play. He is going to have a profound West Coast presence, a profound East Coast presence. It was a no brainer, right? He borrowed 40 million from the hedge fund to secure Magic Hat and buy Pyramid Brewing. So he bought Pyramid Brewing. Held it together. A little bit later 2008 comes along and the hedge fund starts going bankrupt. They start calling in all their notes. They wanted their 40 million back. They can't pay them. So the hedge fund takes both breweries. They take their collateral back and they sell both of those breweries for the price of just one of them.

E: Whoa.

T: So now Allan Newman, the guy who founded Magic Hat, is off trying to create something exciting once again through using Boston Beer’s money. There are places that you can go to get money that can get dangerous. And in our time of growing up I borrowed a lot of 18% and 21% leases.

E: Holy shit!

T: And it almost cost me everything and I really shouldn't have done it. And I probably shouldn't have survived it. Now I got lucky and I was ready and prepared all the time to be as lucky as I could be, but it was only luck that got me through that, and in retrospect it was probably better than the odds that we were going to be toast. There are mistakes you can make and I survived my mistakes but there is no guarantee in that and things get much more dangerous when you do that. And all of the sudden this thing you love doing becomes like a tyranny.

E: And it fucks you up when you take that money… But does anyone lend much money to small businesses anymore? Does anyone lend brewers money?

T: Back then no bank would lend me money.

E: They wouldn't give any breweries money?

T: No, they wouldn't give me money. This was during the dot com bubble and no bank would touch us because it seemed like money was always better spent on some other type of industry. So it's how I ended up going to these real alley leases.

E: It's like the pawn shop lease, or payday lease.

T: Like 21%. I mean if you think about it, it’s like I'm going to to buy a piece of equipment and I'm going to pay a 21% interest on it? Is that business generating a 21% outgross margin to finance that with? Probably not, not at that point.

E: That's intense man. I think that's why this crowdsourcing model is a great option for start up funds. I also like the Community Supported Beer element that people are doing. But then again these types of funds are really a small dent in the overall financial needs brewers have. I do have to say I was a little freaked out when Stone crowdsourced a couple million bucks to get their new brewery made in Europe. I thought that was bullshit. Is this lame? Or is it a testament to the popularity, the loyalty, and the enthusiasm customers have for Stone? I'm not sure which way you want to look at it. Or both.

T: Well the latter is true, but I think they mostly did it as a marketing thing, to create the donors that would do anything to get one of those beers. So they really just know that they are growing their customer base by asking their customers for money. I mean that's one way to do it, but the real bullshit about Stone is the Richmond, Virginia brewery that the city is financing for them.

E: Oh yeah, now that is complete bullshit. I agree with you on that.

T: The city did it at the municipal bond rate which is very low. Nobody gets to borrow at those rates except for the city and the municipality that has the full faith and credit of the taxpayer base to support it. So in that respect, if I was one of those other breweries in that town I would be very upset that somehow this other brewery got their financing at rates that I'll never, ever see.

E: Yeah, if that’s the case then every brewery should have got that financing from the state.

T: I thought about calling them up and saying, alright, we're ready, I'll build one, you do that again. Just to see if they would.

E: Oh no.

T: But they don't want to, I'm sure, so…

E: I like your stance on it. I like the fact you didn't take any government funding here – whether that was TIFF money, SBIFF money or whatever offered you.

T: And the state continued to try and offer us money and I kept saying thank you, we're good. It's good to have friends but...

E: I think it's best not to work with the government in that sense because later there might be strings attached. The fact is they have their foot on your neck already. You don't need to have a fist in your face as well later on.

T: But that's a practical consideration. It is a better use of capital to lease rather than to own. But I have long, long term leases, so it's like owning. But the guy who was my landlord who passed away last Fall was famous for an expression that goes, “Everybody has to chew their own food."

E: That's great, I love that.

T: And some people will and some people prefer not to because they don't have to.

E: I think we could probably float the entire issue of Mash Tun with this conversation, which should probably be a reprint of your book.

T: For the sake of the publisher I should do this. If you want to start a brewery, and basically all the things we've been talking about, every decision, all of those early phase things, I kind of walk through them in great detail because it's a fascinating story. Not that we're fascinating, but is describes what it takes to maneuver a business through the world.

E: Oh absolutely, and that's why I think you are a great spokesman for the industry. It’s good that we have your voice in our corner and you continue to play a leadership role for us.

T: Oh, well that’s great, thanks.

E: I think it's really important that what you do, and what you think can have an impact. I appreciate your stories about how things can be done wrong and how to avoid getting fucked over.

T: You will get fucked over. It's how to survive it, that’s the key thing.

E: Yeah. Well, cheers to your success, thanks for inspiring us.

T: And cheers to yours! I appreciate that.
