18<sup>th</sup> Street Brewery is located in the Miller Beach neighborhood of Gary, IN. A veteran of Chicago’s Pipeworks, and a passionate believer in the power of community, Fox has fought to bring high-quality craft beer to the Steel City. Funded partially by a Kickstarter campaign, 18<sup>th</sup> Street is now up and running. This interview is featured in the latest issue of the Mash Tun Journal.

&nbsp;

<strong>EDMAR:</strong> So what first attracted you to making beer?

&nbsp;

<strong>DREW FOX:</strong> It was my trip to Brussels. I was working at the Swiss Hotel at the time, burned out in the hospitality and food industry and my wife said I should take a trip. So I went to Europe, and went to Belgium. I stayed at a hostel that had a phenomenal wheat beer. I fell in love with it, and I did a couple brewery tours when I was there. I stayed in Brugges for a couple weeks, I was in Ghent, then I went up to Zurich.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: You went to Zurich, Switzerland as well for beer?

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: Yeah.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: I didn't even know the Swiss made good beer.

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: Not really [laughs]. I just fell in love with it. I came back home and couldn't find any of the stuff they had out there, literally nothing. Small import stores, didn't really have a huge selection, but a lot of European beers… Polish beers.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: How long ago was this?

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: Probably 9 or 10 years ago. I came back home and said I love this. Blue Moon had just came out so I drank the shit out of Blue Moon, and slowly but surely craft beer started turning around. Half Acre was opening up so I stopped in to get some beer once and had a brief chat with Gabe and just followed what was going there as much as I could while I was still working in hospitality. Then I got a promotion at work taking over the Lobby Lounge at the hotel as assistant food and beverage manager and I started slowly introducing craft beer into the hotel. My boss saw that and liked it and asked me how much money we would make that year. I told him we would probably do about $1 million. He didn’t believe me. But I teamed up with Summit, Bells, New Holland, and a few other smaller breweries; we got a two-head kegerator behind the bar and we got six steel barrels. Every week we cranked through them because a lot of Europeans love American beers, so whether it was Budweiser or any American beer they want it. Between wine and beer sales we actually end up hitting $1.2 million in sales that year. My bosses still didn’t believe it, but the previous year we had only done $200,000 in sales. It was all craft beer.

&nbsp;

I started home brewing later part of 2008 and in 2009 I started getting really serious about it. I told my wife that I was going to quit my job and build a brewery. She said, "If you think we are secure enough to do it then do it." I told her we weren’t  secure by any means but we'll figure it out.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: So you got the inspiration for this in 2009, you started home brewing, When I first met you I remember you saying you had a SABCO system<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> and you just started fucking around on that. It seemed like you were one of the first people I knew that was starting your own brewery.

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: It was probably right around the same time as Pipeworks. They were probably a little further in their build-up and plan than I was, and they jumped out of the gate really fast. Then Revolution, then everyone else came behind that.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: Well, one of our main focuses at Mash Tun is helping people get into beer. And we’d like to get your advice on starting a brewery: what were the steps that you took, how was your process, what were the first things when you were thinking about, was it about location, was it about funding, or was it about recipes -- or was it about all these things?

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: It was all of the above. I built a test batch facility which I was going to use as a brewery behind my house. We got that Alcohol, Tax and Trade Bureau approved, and then we went to the city and they had no clue what a tack room brewery was. So they said no and it kind of broke my heart a little bit. Right around the same time I met Garrett and BJ and I volunteered over at Pipeworks. And that was great: I was able to get into the business by meeting two great guys who kind of struggled [starting their brewery] and seeing that from day one, seeing how they did it and came through it was amazing.

&nbsp;

But I still had this tack room I couldn’t use, and I started to think, well, what the fuck am I going to do now? Funding became an issue, because running my numbers on the SABCO, I knew I could squeeze it -- but you need the customers to drive your sales and your beer. I didn't customers because Gary, IN didn't have any craft beer market at all. And I had $10,000, enough money to get me started, but $10,000 is only scratching the surface of what you need. So I finally came on full-time with Pipeworks and that was where I really started to understand the funding. It takes a lot of money to run a brewery and people don't get that. It's not just equipment, it's infrastructure. You need the product but you also you need the accounts. If you don't have any of that you are sort of brewing all day long and not really getting anywhere.

&nbsp;

Another thing was that I am probably one of the shyest guys you will ever meet, so it took me a while to learn how to build relationships with people. And I had to get people to know who I was and what 18th Street was is all about.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: So it's about developing relationships with possible places to sell your beer,  it's about having enough money in the bank for your burn rate, you have to have an infrastructure, and the gear cost a lot,  and you gotta make great beer. What you’re saying is that this is actually one of the most challenging small businesses you can open.

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: Absolutely.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: So the interesting thing about Pipeworks is that they did this Kickstarter campaign and they were able to raise significant amount of cash to help them purchase equipment. That is also something you also did. Is that something other people should pursue?

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> I was really against doing a Kickstarter in the beginning, I didn't really want to source funds that way but I didn't really want to take out a bank loan either. It worked out in our favor -- we were able to double the amount of money that we raised -- but at the end of the day it still wasn't enough money to do what I am doing, $23,000 is still scratching the surface.

&nbsp;

But what’s unique about it is I had the opportunity to contract brew beer at Pipeworks and at Spiteful. So you talk about camaraderie and helping each other out: that’s truly helping each other out. Those guys were taking money out of their table to help subsidize me and I think that was probably the greatest gift I have received thus far. You know everyone has been helping out but it really is a fierce, competitive business. And I think you have to go into it knowing that.

&nbsp;

You also have to have a great product. If you look at the shelves now at a Maria's or a Benny's, they are full to capacity. I had a conversation with one of the buyers at Benny's and he told me that with shelf space like that, it’s not sustainable. So you you have start looking two years out and think about how to get ahead of the curve. Say you go to cans: but then cans become saturated so what do you do next? And it’s hard. So while I’m always thinking about getting my beer into the market, I also wanted to open a taproom because that’s where you really can gain revenue.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: Well this other question is this notion of volume. Everyone started out with three barrel system, going to seven or ten. Do you volume is the only way out of this?

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: Not necessarily, a lot of people have asked, why did you just not go into production right away. We could go into production right away but you gain a little more revenue when you have a taproom and when you can self distribute your own beer. With a taproom you keep that money in house. I remember Gabe saying that the taproom and bottle shop really helped sustain Half Acre, and I never forgot it. If we were just to do production I would have to rely on shelf space and kegs but with a taproom I have best of both worlds: I can still distribute my stuff in bottles and the taproom is going to give me the extra income to help sustain 18th Street Brewery. It cost a little more money up front but I think it's probably the smarter move.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: Right, the taproom is the best model for return on investment the beer that you are making, so brewpubs, taprooms, and the like are really the only way to generate significant income to cover your costs. Almost all the cats who open up these smaller breweries right now, they all have a taproom component or growler filling station or whatnot. But the biggest issue too, even at Maria's, is: “is there shelf space?” And then, as a retailer, you have to hand-sell and advocate for certain beers, and that becomes really difficult. And that brings up the bomber market which a lot of people feel is the only way to generate significant income.

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: The bomber market is a double-edged sword. I think there is some saturation in the market but one thing I've looked at is the cost of difference in selling my beer in bomber vs. a keg. The profit margin is higher in bottles. Now, you lose a little bit on kegs but then you gain that back because you don't have the label cost and you don't have the bottle cost. Putting it in kegs is a one-stop shop; but the flip is that you loose the marketing component on store shelves. So, us small guys have to find a balance. Do we keg 50%, do we bottle 50%? At the end of the day, you have to create ROI somewhere and a lot of the smaller guys including myself are still trying to find a way how to do that and still be profitable.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> The location that you have chosen is actually one of the most interesting things about your brewery. I believe that breweries or brewpubs provide amazing function for community development or a way to provide economic, social, cultural development of a neighborhood. Great Lakes in Cleveland transformed a downtown neighborhood, and you look at what’s happening in all these Michigan Lake front breweries --

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: The Livery in Benton Harbor.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> -- right, and you're going to Miller Beach which is a part of Gary, IN. Miller Beach has been a community that has been kind of fighting for decades to reinvigorate that small downtown area. By creating a brewpub there you provide an additional reason for someone to come out to Miller Beach. So was that something that you were aware of when you were planning the brewery?

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> Yes and no. We always knew that we were going to be in Gary. We looked at downtown Gary because we knew that downtown definitely needed some revitalization but the problem was we would be only source of business infrastructure. Our survival rate probably would have been nil, even though [the location] was close to the train station. So we met with some city folks and they advised us to consider Miller Beach. I had been to Miller Beach several times with my kids and we did more research and the income level there, the foot traffic, and the train station made the decision easy. Everyone still says we have one of the best locations for a new brewery in Indiana. We are half a block from the South-shore train station, less than a quarter mile from the beach, and being in affluent area gives us the best of both worlds.

&nbsp;

But we just don't want to be this Brewery stuck in this affluent neighborhood and out of touch with the people on the West side of Gary or the people in Glen Park, because the brewery is not just for Miller Beach, the brewery is for Gary. I want people to understand that.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> I am excited by that. Now I know that you have run into some problems with –

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: No shit.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> – developing the brewery so what are the things that you would suggest to keep in mind before signing the dotted line on that lease?

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> Well make sure you have a fucking architect. You need a licensed architect, it's really expensive and that’s one lesson I learned. Don't depend on the city to do shit for you. We have never asked Gary for money and we never will. But initially we thought we would get some support and that it would continue. We don’t want the keys to the city but we have a great business model and we thought they would support that business model a little bit better than they have. And so that has kind of turned me off in the last couple months. But, never depend on the city: take your business model to the city and let them know who you are, what you are, and what you are going to do. Make sure you have the proper funding. And then, hire an architect because when you have to build another bathroom or you have to put in additional plumbing –

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: – licensed plumbers, licensed electricians, the license to charge you double.

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: Yeah, in our case I didn't plan for certain things because I thought we didn’t  need them, and then the city said no, no, no, no.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> So you are saying the architectural plans would have saved you money. How?

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: Because you go to the city, with your architectural plans, and they have a clear understanding of what you want to do. We had an architect, but we had an architect that wasn't licensed in the city of Gary or the state of Indiana. We had someone from Chicago do our drawings, and we weren't told [that this was a problem] -- and I didn't ask the question. So the money that we were going to use to build out the brewery immediately went to an architect which immediately put us in a rut again.

&nbsp;

At that point were are already knee deep in and you can't pull out so I sold my Harley, I sold some stocks and bonds, and thank god we didn't have a mortgage on the house. We thought about putting a second mortgage up, but thankfully through the Kickstarter campaign we found some people who really understood our concept and really wanted us to get off the ground. We had some local ONE8 members who donated some funds, we had our contractor do a little bit of the work pro-bono for us, and all that helped. That doesn't mean that we were not in a rut, and all of these things cost money and time.

&nbsp;

I think the time issue for me is what drives me nuts because every day that you are not open you lose money and the city doesn't care because they don't understand. But everyday we're not open is a day I can't hire one or two or three employees in a city where our unemployment rate is at an all-time high of 70%. That’s the highest anywhere in the country. And you would think the city would understand and be like, hey, here is a guy who is bringing business -- but they don't get that. As you said, the brewery is cutting edge when it comes to economic and social development, and I think as brewers we have to do a better job of explaining that.

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: The role of a brewery in a community.

&nbsp;

<strong>D</strong>: Absolutely.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> That's a really good point. One of the things you actually helped me out was helping me out with my licensing through the Alcohol, Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). I would say that’s another super important thing. Right?

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> Hell, yeah. But the thing is: you really can't even do that application process until you have the architectural plans until you have a lease -- which is utterly insane because you have your architecture plans, you have a lease, but then the TTB has to look at your shit and determine whether or not you are going to get your license. That's three or four months of waiting for them  -- so you just burn three to four months of your lease.

&nbsp;

It's one of those things that I've learned and it’s what everyone says: you really have to know your state, local, and federal laws. TTB is just a component of that and if you don't have that piece of paper, you can't even brew beer. You can home-brew but you can't brew beer for sale. TTB was definitely a hurdle for me. Luckily we had a good agent that helped us out through our process. I always share that information with new breweries because TTB seems very daunting. Yet, you have to do it right the first time. It’s daunting, there’s tons of paperwork -- but it's really simple.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> Really? One of the key things is you have to find a consultant.

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> It may seem daunting but it's one of the easiest processes to go through. It will take you an hour to go through all that paper work it's not really that difficult.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> So the other hurdle at this point is money. Based on your estimates and of course everything has changed at this time, how off were you on your estimates?

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> As Gerrit said to me, to open a small nanobrewery on this scale you need about $100,000, roughly. If you find a good deal on your lease, you find some used equipment and you have people donating things to you, you can get away with $50,000. In our estimate, and based on what we wanted to do, we were roughly about $30,000 short. If everything had gone as planned we would have been open two months ago. Again, you have to know, yes, you need an architect, you have to know that you need two bathrooms. Being off as much as I was, I still think we will recoup that in the first 3 months we will be open but without the taproom or bottle shop we would have struggled.

&nbsp;

My goal was not to take a bank loan out, and I don't like asking people for money. There are enough people out there that are interested in our project and wanted to invest in our project, but I thought it was important for me to own 100% of the company. So I thought it was important for me to source the funding the way I have and I think it's important for people to look at. There are a lot of venture capitalists out there that want to give you money but they all want something in return. I also think there are a lot of people out there that have money and want to give to a project like 18th Street Brewery. They are not asking for a return, they believe in it. I found that more important and more giving, I think that is what true community is. They want to support your business and I think if you have a great business model and plan they I don't want to say have nothing to fear but they want to support you.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> That's pretty rare.

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> It is very rare, sometimes I get choked up about it because there will be a day when I walk into the brewery and I say, shit I wasn't expecting this and now how am I going to get $2000 to do this? Luckily we have been able to make up some ground. We’re still about $10-15,000 short.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> It's going to happen.

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> We already started construction and we are going to keep going. We have all the gear. Whether we get the production side open first, the taproom open a little bit later, we are right where we need to be.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> That's fantastic. What else do you think would be important for someone to do when they are starting their brewery?

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> Learn as much as you can about your local laws and state laws and if you can afford to do it, hire a really good excise attorney who understands liquor and beverage law and stuff like that. Indiana is a little bit different from the state of Illinois, and both are different from every other state. When you apply for your paperwork you want someone who knows how that works and that will help you through the process as well. Have a good lawyer so that you are not getting screwed on certain things.

&nbsp;

<strong>E:</strong> My suggestion if you were to read this article, if you are looking to start a brewery and you need a consultant, call Drew.

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> There are a lot of people out there. I think it's important that we keep our doors open, and it's a very competitive market but I don't want to see anyone fail when they are starting this business. I am always willing to give up my time because people have done so much for me already and that’s the least I can do. We are still going to be competitive no matter what but –

&nbsp;

<strong>E</strong>: The ultimate competitor is Budweiser, Miller, and Coors, it's not each other. So we are fighting on multiple fronts, in multiple battles, in different communities everywhere do help proselytize quality for beverages, beer, etc. That's the main battle.

&nbsp;

<strong>D:</strong> Exactly.
