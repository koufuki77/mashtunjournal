<em>by Paul Durica</em>

On a trip to Mexico City as a young boy, Oscar Neebe learned the truth about his grandfather, the man whose name he shared. An uncle had taken the fifteen-year-old to a May Day celebration and stopped at the Palace of Justice along the way to point out a large mural by Diego Rivera. It included a reference to the bombing that had occurred in Haymarket Square in Chicago in 1886. Eight anarchists were put on trial in connection with the bombing. Among them was Oscar’s grandfather, the original Neebe, remembered, if at all, as a saloonkeeper on Halsted Street.

Long before Neebe ran a bar, he and his brothers sold yeast to breweries and helped to organize the first union of brewery workers in Chicago. And before that, he had worked as a tinsmith, a bucket-maker, a ship’s cook, and a bartender. He even worked as an office manager at a newspaper, the working-class German-language <i>Arbeiter Zeitung</i> (which is how he ended up on trial and sentenced to fifteen years at the penitentiary in Joliet). Oscar Neebe had many skills, many of them practical , but wherever he worked, he invariably got into trouble for standing up for the rights of his fellow workers.

The bombing in Haymarket Square has been called many things—an affair, a riot, a massacre, a tragedy—depending on who happens to be telling the story at the moment. What all can agree on—capital and labor, police and anarchists, the politicians and the press—is that a public meeting had been called for  the evening of May 4 in response to the suppression of a strike that ended in the fatal shooting of two strikers bypolice at the McCormick Reaper Works, manufacturer of the famous mechanical reaper. As a large public market capable of accommodating an audience of thousands, Haymarket Square had been selected as the site for the meeting, but its organizer, August Spies, editor of the <i>Arbeiter Zeitung</i>, shifted it one block east and one block south onto a less congested side street in order to avoid provoking the police. As a result, the Haymarket affair (or riot or what-have-you) didn’t even occur in the Square. The speakers had been selected that day and the meeting started almost an hour late.

According to witnesses, the crowd never numbered more than 3,000, perhaps as low as 1,500: a mix of laborers (then participating in a nationwide push for an eight-hour work day), political radicals, and the curious, including Chicago’s mayor. Around 10:30 PM, with a storm threatening and the mayor on his way back to his mansion, the third and final speaker, Samuel Fielden, was wrapping up his remarks when a detachment of close to 180 policemen marched up the street a mere block from the station .  The police came armed and the crowd, now only a couple of hundred, was wary. Before either side could say or do much of anything, someone threw a bomb into the ranks of the police. Fifteen minutes of gunfire followed the explosion. Eight officers ultimately died as a result of the wounds they sustained that evening, as did an unknown number of the public. Scores were wounded. Chicago had become the site of the first major act of urban terrorism in the United States.

Oscar Neebe did not make it to Haymarket that night. Apparently, while seated at a bar and enjoying a beer, he’d seen one of the 20,000 handbills that Spies had printed up urging working men to attend the meeting. According to Spies’ testimony, Neebe’s made a passing remark about the inevitability of violence in the struggle for the eight-hour day after learning of the incident at McCormick. When Spies, Adolf Fischer, and Michael Schwab (all worked for the <i>Arbeiter Zeitung</i>) were arrested in connection with the bombing, Neebe, as a member of the board of directors, slipped into the editor’s chair in order to ensure that the newspaper continued publishing. For his efforts, he too was arrested.

As even the prosecution would later concede, Neebe had nothing to do with the bombing in Haymarket Square. But he wasn’t merely, as some historians have suggested, the wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time, an accidental anarchist—he was, in truth, a socialist. His commitment to increasing wages, shortening hours, and improving working conditions – particularly for women and children – had produced  real world results, as in the case of the founding of Brewers Local No. 1. Appropriately for a yeast manufacturer, he had become radicalized while working as a bartender at the age of seventeen:

Here I had a chance to see and study the life of the working people. Mostly workmen from the McCormick Machine works stopped there, and many of them made good wages. I saw and heard how it was made; I saw that foremen received commission and royalty from poorer workmen; saw how sneaks and spies watched every word the workmen said, to report the same to the foremen, and saw good workmen sent away.

Neebe worked at the bar during his first stint in Chicago in the mid-1860s. Although born in the United States, he had gone back to his ancestral Germany for his education. He returned to New York at the age of fourteen and from there, went to Chicago. The move was the start of an odyssey that took him from Cleveland to Philadelphia to New York again before finally settling in Chicago in 1877. The yeast business he established with his brothers  gave him a certain measure of autonomy, but, once again, his work brought him into contact with those less fortunate. As he followed his route to work through the working class neighborhoods on the city’s southwest side, he frequently saw “mothers cry, as they had to send their little ones (who by right belonged in school) to the factories or stores so they could live.” By this time a father of two, Neebe devoted himself to the cause of ending child labor.

The Haymarket trial began in June and ended in August. The police could never identify the bomber, so the organizers of the meeting were put on trial instead, along with other radical labor figures. Their words and beliefs were held up as a provocation for acts of violence and used to establish their culpability in the bombing. His children were allowed to see him only briefly during the trial and not at all after he was sent to the prison. At his sentencing, he asked to receive the death penalty so that his children could “go to the grave, and kneel down beside it” while they would not be allowed to “go to the penitentiary and see their father, who was convicted of a crime he didn’t have anything to do with.”

Of the eight on trial, all but Neebe were sentenced to hang. Four were eventually executed. A fifth committed suicide in prison, and two others joined Neebe at Joliet after asking for and receiving clemency from the governor of Illinois. At the penitentiary, Neebe was Prisoner 8376 and initially worked at making harnesses for horses. His wife had died, leaving his children, for all practical purposes, orphans. He had not been allowed to attend the funeral. But he did have friends on the outside.

Almost immediately after his sentencing, the brewery workers Neebe had helped  unionize began to help him. In December 1887, the Beer-Brewers and Malster’s Union No. 1 transformed their second annual dance at the Northside Turner hall into a clemency campaign for Neebe. Beer-related events often served as sites for political organization in the city. Beer gardens and beer halls offered informal places for meetings and discussions, and even the more politically-oriented workers halls, like Zeph’s Hall and Grief’s Hall, which were close to where the bombing had occurred, had first-floor, fully-stocked saloons. The first mass protest in Chicago in 1855 had been in response to the enforced  closing of bars and saloons on Sundays and an increase in the cost of liquor licenses. The Lager Beer Riot, as the incident was called, marked the entrance of the German and Irish communities into Chicago politics. In the immediate aftermath of the Haymarket bombing, many of the city’s bars and saloons were once again closed, as police and politicians worried about the possible outcome of cold beer combined with heated talk.

The effort for clemency on the part of the brewers’ union in Chicago joined up with a larger national campaign, which in the early 1890s led a new governor of Illinois, John Peter Altgeld, to review the transcripts of the Haymarket trial. Altgeld concluded that all of the men, but especially Neebe, were innocent of the crimes of which they had been convicted. In June 1893, the three in prison were pardoned and made their first public appearance, appropriately enough for Neebe, at a brewers’ union meeting.

Neebe would subsequently marry a woman who had been active in the clemency effort. She owned a saloon on Halsted near the stockyards and later, she and Neebe managed one on Randolph, which became the site of frequent political meetings. Neebe played an active part in the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the early 1900s, an attempt to form one union for all trades; however, as a neighborhood saloonkeeper, he practiced an everyday activism. A year after his pardon, he appeared in court, this time as the plaintiff. A man had broken into the cellar of the bar and stolen a valuable bottle of wine, but Neebe, realizing that the unemployed man had a family, refused to press charges. How could he take a father away from his children over a bottle of wine?

Neebe had more children with his second wife, including the father of Oscar William Neebe, who would learn about his family’s past from a Diego Rivera mural in Mexico City. Oscar Neebe, the committed socialist and bartender, died in 1916 at the age of sixty-five. The <i>Tribune</i> would report in 1902 that his establishment had a place of honor near the stockyards , among what had become  the “longest row of saloons in Chicago.”
