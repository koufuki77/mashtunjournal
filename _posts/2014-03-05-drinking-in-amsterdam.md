Unless you are a local, finding cool (non tourist laden) places in Amsterdam to drink in is a pain in the ass. But part of the fun of Amsterdam is wandering around, getting lost, retracing your steps, losing your rental bike, and pissing in the canals after drinking a place dry. If you only had a day in the ‘Dam these are my  go to places to grab a cold one.

<b>De Bierkoning</b>

It’s worth a break in the tumult to get over to de Bierkoning, the best beer shop in Holland. Founded in the 80s, it's located right off Dam Square. They feature some of the greatest beers in the world and carefully cellar such rare and delicious brews that any beer geek may cry, get down on their knees and thank Ninkasi. The sours cellar may have made me giddy, but their American craft beer selection made me laugh. The only good stuff they have is smuggled in by beer nerds who trade American brew for stuff we think is rare.

I spoke with the super friendly and awesome managers, Jan and Alice, who will happily show you the way to Beervana. Although a difficult task, they gave me their top ten favorite beers that they have in the store:

<strong>Brouwerij de Prael</strong>

This brewpub is located near the north end of the Red Light District, down one of many narrow side streets. If memory serves, it was just around the corner from the Dildo Experience.  De Prael is set in a former auction house and wheelwright shop on the Prinsengracht Canal. It's a pretty sweet brewery, using traditional methods 100% organic grains.  But De Prael is more than a brewery, it is also a social institution, providing jobs for people with psychiatric handicaps --the first of its kind in the Netherlands. De Prael is beer with a social mission, something I really admire.

<b>De Wildeman</b>

This legendary bar in a former distillery is a place you’ll find beer guru, Michael Jackson, hanging out with the Dutch beer cognoscenti on another cute-as-fuck side street. They have 18 drafts and about 250 bottles from around the world. For a taste of local, they have a lot of small Dutch brews from the likes of De Molen and Emelisse on draft.  So if you want to go Dutch, make it happen here. [Editor’s note: If you ain’t Dutch, you ain’t much.] I do not remember how I got to this magical place, so good luck Google-Mapping it.

<b>Brouwerij 't IJ</b>

Obviously [see adjoining article] Brouwerij 't IJ is my favorite place to enjoy a beer in Amsterdam. The brewery is only open from 2-8pm and it is simply amazing to sit under the windmill by a canal and drink an afternoon and evening away. The brewery serves cheeses that are made by a farmer who uses the brewery’s spent grain to feed his cows and goats. And Patrick knows the best butcher in town, so the menu also features his articulate charcuterie.

<b>The Beer Temple</b>

The owner of Dutch beer bar <a href="http://www.arendsnest.nl/"><b>Arendsnest</b></a> (another bar you should check out), opened this American craft beer bar in 2009. They have 30 draft lines and around a hundred American bottles on their list. But why in the hell would you want to drink American craft beer while you're visiting Holland? For the impressive draft list, of course; those genius mother fuckers from Mikkeller and Evil Twin often have their stuff here. But don't think it will be more affordable. The good shit costs the same in Holland as it does in the US, if not more. Fucking Euro.
