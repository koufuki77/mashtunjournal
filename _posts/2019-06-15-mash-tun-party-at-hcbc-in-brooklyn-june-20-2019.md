Join us Thursday, June 20th from 5-10pm at the Kings County Brewing Collective for the New York release party of issue #13 of <em>Mash Tun Journal</em>. This issue features Guest Editor Miguel Rivas <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thebeertrekker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Beertrekker</a>, whose photographs featured in the Journal will be on display in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KCBCbeer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kings County Brewers Collective</a> taproom.

Goundlings Pizza Co. will be here in the Taproom slinging meatball sammys 6-9pm!

The Journal is supported by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarzCommunityBrewing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marz Community Brewing</a>, who coincidentally will be brewing a collaboration brew with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KCBCbeer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kings County Brewers Collective</a> and will also be hanging out at the release party sharing a few of their beers.

Come by and say hi, and let us know what you would like to see happen in the next edition of the journal which is now freely distributed at breweries, bottle shops, taprooms and bars across the country.

Mash Tun features contributions by: Kurt Boomer, Jacob Ciocci, Cain Czopek, Franklyn, Nick Gingold, Ben Macri, Michael Maloney, Jack Muldowney, Dan Murphy, Daniel Pische, Miguel Rivas, and Doug Veliky.
