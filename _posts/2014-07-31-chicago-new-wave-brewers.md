Over the year we have  interviewed some of our favorite new breweries. Like <a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2014/03/a-conversation-with-tom-korder-and-eric-hobbs-of-penrose-brewing-company/">Penrose</a> in Geneva, and <a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2013/11/a-conversation-with-18th-street-brewerys-drew-fox/">18th Street</a> in Gary, Indiana. We haven't had enough room or time to talk about others we love so in Issue 5 of <em>Mash Tun</em> <em>Journal</em> we printed a directory of the new wave of breweries that have launched in Chicagoland over the past few years. This is a list of some of our favorites:

&nbsp;

<a href="http://alesyndicate.com/"><strong><em>Ale Syndicate</em></strong></a>
<em>YEAR FOUNDED: 2013</em>
<em>RUN BY: Samuel and Jesse Evans</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: Bryan Shimkos</em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BEER: Sunday Session</em>

“The two biggest things we care about are making good beer and this city,” says Jesse. “Chicago has audacity and grit, and we design all of our recipes to reflect that. We’ve also tried to have our recipes incorporate ingredients that have historically been grown here.”

The next big thing for AS is getting their new Logan Square brewery space up and running. “That’s going to be a big moment for us, and it’s right around the corner,” says Samuel. “ We’ve been brewing at a lot of our friends’ spaces across Illinois, but it’s really exciting to open up this space and get to work on a lot of ideas that we’ve had knocking around for the past few months. And we love this neighborhood – we live here and we just feel really connected to it, so that makes it extra special for us.”

The Syndicate’s already off to a fast start: bottles of its suds can be found everywhere across the city, and they scooped a major honor last year when Rate Beer voted Ale Syndicate as the Best New Brewery in Illinois.

“We’re really proud of that,” says Jesse. “And were’ really proud to be part of that Class of 2013 here in Chicago!”

<a href="http://www.atlasbeercompany.com/"><strong><em>Atlas Brewery</em></strong></a>
<em>YEAR FOUNDED: 2012</em>
<em>RUN BY: John and Ben Saller</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: John and Ben Saller</em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BEER: Golden Ale</em>

Located just steps away from Delilah's, Chicago's beloved whiskey dive bar, it was never going to be easy for Atlas Brewery to succeed. Since opening in 2012, however, they have quickly become a neighborhood staple, housing a draft list that balances seasonal specials (Oktoberfest, a pink beer for Valentine's Day) with some mainstay customer favorites (Golden Ale). Brothers John and Ben Saller, acting as owners and head brewers, have developed a complete establishment, focusing just as much on the kitchen as on the beer, hiring head chef Joe Pierro to create dishes intended for beer pairings. The menu features items just as appropriate for a pub as for a white tablecloth dinner, ranging from a duck confit poutine to an Angus burger. Atlas has also played home to the local home brewing community, hosting informal workshops on Tuesdays where brewers can taste the creations of their fellow fermenters and offers free brewery tours on Wednesdays (or you could simply ask your bartender). For those more interested in consuming beer rather than creating it, Atlas's deep booths and wood bar is fitting for a night out with friends or a quiet date night.

<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2014/07/chicago-new-wave-brewers/buckledown_taphandles/" rel="attachment wp-att-477"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-477" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/buckledown_taphandles.jpg" alt="buckledown_taphandles" width="500" height="344" /></a>

<a href="http://buckledownbrewing.com/"><strong><em>BuckleDown Brewery</em></strong></a>
<em>YYEAR FOUNDED: 2013</em>
<em>RUN BY: Ike Orcutt and Sean Mahoney</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: Ike Orcutt</em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BEERS: Belt &amp; Suspenders American IPA; Fiddlesticks Belgian IPA</em>

BuckleDown brewery landed in Lyons last year and is the brainchild of Ike Orcutt and Sean Mahoney. BuckleDown gestated in late 2012, after drinking some beers at Haymarket Brewery. Long-time fans of craft beer, Sean and Ike decided to take the plunge. After mentoring with local brewers and working on a few larger-scale systems, the pair put together a plan.

Their first and foremost consideration was a location that had the City of Chicago's water.  Ike says he "Loves the Chicago brewing scene because there are so many solid beers and breweries here.  We’re just going to focus on making great beer and leave it to someone else to figure out where we fit in."

Ike added that they decided on the city of Lyons because "there is a big population of craft drinkers without a really local option." The combination of creating a home team brewery and finding an amazing location with exposed wood-trussed roof, high ceilings and really good street exposure sealed the deal.

With a 15-bbl brewhouse, Buckledown hopes to brew about 1,000 bbls in their first year.  They're on draft only for now, but by the end of 2014 we can expect to see their suds on shelves.

<a href="http://www.dryhopchicago.com/"><strong><em>DryHop Brewers</em></strong></a>
<em>YEAR FOUNDED: 2013</em>
<em>RUN BY: Greg Shuff</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: Brant Debovic</em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BEER: Shark Meets Hipster wheat ale</em>

Tucked in the craft beer desert that is Chicago's East Lakeview, DryHop Brewers have become a staple in a neighborhood known mostly for Versace-bag-swinging blondes and restaurants serving the latest yuppie diet fetish. Their ales are hoppy, their chef obsessed with bacon, and their space a living display of the brewing process, DryHop Brewers seems to only live in the extremes. Their beers (as of this writing) are only available in the brewpub although an ever-changing selection of kettle-to-tap offerings and seasonal food menu (including brunch for those who wake up before noon on the weekends) keep the place packed and the wait-list long.

Brant Debovic, who has a decade of experience, which includes a GABF gold and running a brewpub, mans the brewery constantly churning out challenging and inventive beers. Former Charlie Trotter sous chef and Four Seasons veteran Pete Repak is the chef, a DIY aficionado who scours farmer's markets to create the comfort food with a twist on your plate. Although run by two bold frontrunners in the food and beer industry, egos are put aside for the sake of collaboration, as the food and beer is intended to be complementary.

DryHop is the challenging, yet balanced, destination the industry needs: a complete establishment, existing as both a restaurant and a brewery where care, precision, and creativity share equal billing behind the kettle and the fryer. After all, why wouldn't you go to a place that had a series of beers called Hope, Empire, and Jedi?

<a href="http://horsethiefbrewing.com/"><strong><em>Horse Thief Hollow</em></strong></a>
<em>YEAR FOUNDED: 2013</em>
<em>RUN BY: Neil Byer</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: David Williams</em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BEER:  Annexation Ale IPA, Black Sox Black Ale</em>

Back in the 1850's the neighborhood of Beverly Chicago was know as Horse Thief Hollow. The story goes that horses stolen from Missouri brought to the market in Chicago were hidden in the dense forest growth of the area. The hilly area had great look out points and was a great den for thieves. This local lore inspired Beverly native Neil Byer to open his brewpub and restaurant.

Fast forward 164 years and most Chicagoan's wouldn't be able to locate Beverly, let alone the area where these horses were hidden away. But Neil has put Beverly back on the map, at least for craft beer fans. The updated Horse Thief Hollow is located on Western Ave near 104th Street, about a mile away from where Mash Tun's publisher grew up, granting the brewpub some important south side pride points.

Byers is a chef and was a home brewer for five years and he added veteran brewer David Williams, president of the Chicago Homebrew Alchemists of Suds (CHAOS) Brew Club to his team. The two are making brews that pair well with Byers menu. Artisan bread, cheese, smoked meats and sausages complement a wide range of offerings on their gastropub menu. The beer is seasonally brewed using the best ingredients available in the mid west.
To experience the goodness of what "Brewed in Beverly" means you'll have to map Horse Thief Hollow in your phone. We don't expect their brews to make it to the north side anytime soon.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MiddleBrow?hc_location=timeline"><strong><em>Middle Brow Brewing Co.</em></strong></a>
<em>YEAR FOUNDED: 2012</em>
<em>RUN BY: Nick Burica, Bryan Grohnke, and Peter Ternef</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: N/A, see below</em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BEER: Middlebrow produces a single beer at a time</em>

Middle Brow is a unique beer company because of the collaborative nature of their production. Roughly half of their beer recipes are created in-house (they hire a local brewer for actual production); the other half are the winners from themed home-brew contests they organize—the winners get their beer made and 50% of the proceeds are donated to charity. Currently, Middle Brow is producing one beer at a time. “The Life Pursuit” is their most recent beer: it’s a “dark saison style ale with vanilla and cinnamon” created by Matt Holley, who won their first home-brew contest back in 2012.

Aside from producing flavorful and complex brews, Middle Brow also uses great graphics: the “Life Pursuit” label is adorned with a tongue-in-cheek illustration depicting a bearded gentleman, in flannel and beanie, on a ladder pulling a beer bottle down from a bottle-lined shelf. This rich illustration is encircled within the same silhouette, of a man’s head in profile, elegantly used in the beer’s pseudoscientific logo.

It looks like Middle Brow has a recipe for success: by supporting the art of home brewing (the owners are passionate hobbyists with day jobs), giving to charitable causes (they are currently working with Chicago-based anti-violence group Cure Violence), sourcing natural quality ingredients, and making innovative small batches of seasonal beer, Middle Brow has earned a cult following among Chicago beer aficionados.

<a href="http://www.lakeeffectbrewing.com/"><strong><em>Lake Effect </em></strong></a>
<em>YEAR FOUNDED: 2012</em>
<em>RUN BY: Clint Bautz and Lynn Ford</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: Clint Bautz </em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BEER: Lake Effect Snow (a 5.4% Wit)</em>

Two of the nicest brewery owners Mash Tun has ever met are Clint Bautz and Lynn Ford. These two former long time home-brewers met at Ravens, talked about their liquid dreams and made the leap a few years ago. After making plans for a brewery for the Northwest side for a few years, they settled in to a back-alley warehouse off I90 in Portage Park and started brewing.

Right off the bat Lake Effect became the neighborhood brewery for the Portage Park area. They brought fresh, well-crafted beer directly to the local community and supplied neighborhood bars, restaurants and liquor stores. They also went bonkers on collaborative brewing with chefs, restaurateurs, bars, other breweries and coffee roasters around the city. This collaborative spirit defines the New Wave of Chicago breweries. Often times Breweries in planning partner up with breweries in operation to help bring their beer and brand recognition to the market. Lake Effect has helped Dryhop, Ale Man, Marz Community Brewing Co and many others design beers and share them with the public. It’s one of the reasons we like them so much.

Lake Effect will be expanding operations soon with a new tap room that will house their barrel aging program and give the public a chance to taste beer fresh from their tanks. Recently a new Yeast manufacturer, Omega Yeast Labs, opened up next door, and Lake Effect has been using Omega strains on a variety of brett beers and other styles. Omega is going to fuel a lot of brews in Chicago and the fact the company exists is a testament to the growth of Chicago land breweries.  We expect more great brews and experimentation to come.

<a href="http://www.offcolorbrewing.com/"><strong><em>Off Color Brewing </em></strong></a>
<em>Year Founded: 2013</em>
<em>Run by: John Laffler &amp; Dave Bleitner</em>
<em>Flagship beers: Troublesome and Scurry</em>

Off Color Brewing runs its modest 20 bbl. brewhouse in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago. Opened in 2013 by industry vets John Laffler (previously of Goose Island) and Dave Bleitner (previously of Two Brothers), you won’t find Off Color peddling the same old beers you’ve grown used to. In fact, that’s their M.O. –avant-garde brewing. Case in point: Troublesome and Scurry, their two year-round offerings. The former is a highly sessionable Blended Wheat Beer that closely resembles the old-school gose beers of Germany. With its incorporation of coriander and salt, accompanied by slight tartness and acidity, Troublesome is refreshing and won’t wreck your palate. Scurry, on the other hand, is a Dark Honey Ale that clocks in at 5.3% ABV and showcases both honey and molasses with restrained nuance. Both should mainstays in any fridge looking for respite from IPA overload.

While Off Color has made their mark with these two flagships, they should not be overlooked for their one-offs, collaborations and other specialty beers. Whether it’s a gin barrel-aged Radler (Radlersnake), a 3.5% Russian Imperial Stout (Beer Geek Mus), or a Smoke Beer (15ft), Laffler and Bleitner are nothing if not adventurous. They’re clearly trying to make noise in an industry that can at times seem homogenous, and as long as they keep churning out beers that are both interesting and tasty, we’ll keep coming back.

<a href="http://www.ponybrewing.com/"><strong><em>One Trick Pony </em></strong></a>
<em>Year Founded: 2012</em>
<em>Run By: Mark Kocol</em>
<em>Flagship Beer: Spotted Saddle</em>

Mark Kocol started One Trick Pony in 2012 in Lansing, Ill. after two previous attempts at opening a brewery fell through. His third attempt has flown under the radar – so far – while other Chicagoland startups continue to enter the marketplace with as much visibility as they can achieve. Kocol, for now, has opted to stick to making beer – which he happens to do very well (we recommend the Warlander – a citrusy, 11% Imperial IPA that goes down as effortlessly as a glass of water). Insisting with his business partner Dave Murphy that they not be considered a one trick pony, Kocol brews everything from APAs to Belgian Dubbels to Barrel-aged Russian Imperial Stouts and wants to continue to explore his capabilities, including cask-conditioned ales.  We welcome that curiosity with thirsty palates.

While you may find one of their beers on tap at a bar, if you really want to know what One Trick Pony is all about, visit the brewery and take a seat in the taproom. It’s a no frills joint with mismatched bar furniture, random art and used growlers lining the walls. But it’s not the physical makeup that makes it a great place to drink a beer. It’s the people. On any given day at the taproom you can be sure a local will strike up a friendly conversation, talk up the beer and offer stories from their own life. It never fails. The folks at One Trick Pony have somehow combined the vibe of a neighborhood dive with a world-class brewery. There may be no better place to grab a pint or two. (See our accompanying feature on page XX)

One Trick Pony currently distributes kegs throughout the Chicagoland area, but be on the lookout for bottled offerings to hit liquor stores in late 2014.

<a href="http://www.slapshotbrewing.com/home/"><strong><em>SlapShot </em></strong></a>
<em>YEAR FOUNDED: 2013</em>
<em>RUN BY: Brian and Steven Miller</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: Steven Miller</em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BREWS: Maybe the 1926, a rye pale ale.</em>

GUESS WHAT?
Hockey and beer? Never heard of such a thing!
Ok, it’s no shock that a brewery called SlapShot is full of hockey players and big hockey fans. “Oh yeah, we’re Hawks season ticket holders,” says head brewer Steven with a laugh. “All of us are fans, and Brian and I still play. Our backers are big fans too. And that’s why we named our rye pale ale ‘1926:’ after the year the Blackhawks were founded.”

SlapShot, which began as a hobby and slowly grew into a full-time brewery, has always kept the social drinker’s needs firmly in their sights. “We brew sessionable beers,” says Steven. “We want something you can drink all day, that’s got some full flavor – but doesn’t knock you over when you get off the bar stool.”

The Miller brothers actually never thought they’d get to open a brewery, but after six or seven years of making brews for fun, the time was right to take the plunge. “The equipment evolved, we evolved and we always talked about opening a brewery one day,” says Steven. “And we got to place in our lives where we could. So we did it.”

SlapShot is in the midst of a growth phase right now, all spurred by careful planning and the great reception they’ve received in Chicagoland. “We started contract brewing at Urban Legend, and that was great, but we had limited capacity and could only get one beer out,” says Steven. “And our main account, the Beer Bistro, just blew through it. That was really gratifying and now that we’re able to brew on our own, we’re able to stretch a little bit.”

Next up for SlapShot is to can beers, something that will come on line in the next 60 days, and will retail in 16 oz four-packs. “We think we can release a lot more beers to the public that way with a lot more variation,” says Steven. Also on the radar is the SMASH Project, which sounds like a cross-check but is actually an acronym.
“We’re going to do an entire line using single malt and single hops, and a different set in each run,” says Steven. “We’re excited about that – it’s going to be cool!”

<a href="http://uneannee.com/"><strong><em>Une Année  </em></strong></a>
<em>YEAR FOUNDED: 2012</em>
<em>RUN BY: Jerry Nelson</em>
<em>HEAD BREWER: Jerry Nelson and Dustin Zimmerman</em>
<em>FLAGSHIP BEER: Maya, a Belgian IPA</em>

Une Année’s Jerry Nelson picked up homebrewing in the mid-90s, catching the first wave of West Coast brewing when he was stationed with the Marines in California, With only a brief intermission while Nelson completed school, he has been brewing non-stop ever since, and finally decided to taker the plunge. It took three years to plan, raise the money needed, and do a year of brewing school at Siebel before he was ready to pull the trigger, but now, Une Année’s nine-barrel production brewery, located in the Kinzie Industrial Corridor, is online and producing fine craft brews in the Belgian and French tradition.

Nelson’s focus is to make Une Année the home for Belgian-inspired beer in the Midwest and he hopes his brewery will one day have the same recognition and cachet as Ommegang Brewery. Une Année will only brew Belgian and French style beers over the next few years, part of a modest plan that includes growing above and beyond 10,000 barrels a year, building out a tasting room, and ultimately moving into a larger space to showcase their great products.
