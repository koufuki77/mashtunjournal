&nbsp;

Upon entering <a href="http://www.atgbrewery.com/">Against The Grain</a>'s brewing facility in Louisville, Kentucky you will witness a jaw-dropping three-tier brewing system, something you might see in Bavaria. You walk into a room that has a ceiling 60 feet high. To the left is the bar and kitchen; to the right is seating. A giant glass wall behind the bar shows their system which features a brewhouse on the third floor, fermentation tanks on a second floor, and the serving tanks behind the bar on the first floor. It looks amazing, but this three-tier system is brutal. It can be a physically taxing brew day here for a brewer of any age. Despite its visual complexity this is a very basic DME brewhouse with your standard 15-barrel tanks. It works great. And what's even better is that these guys make some of the best liquid in the world.

I've had the pleasure of meeting some of the ATG guys a few times during my stints at Maria's and at their brewery. We were amazed by their 70K Imperial Stout, Kentucky Ryed Chiquen (packaged with chicken feathers), and Bo and Luke Imperial Stout. We would just order whatever they made regardless of tasting it in advance because we knew it was good shit. While we were in planning mode for our own brewery, Marz Community Brewing Co, we were able to con Head Brewer and Owner, Jerry Gnagy, and Head Lover, Sam Cruz, to let us brew with them. It was our first of what we hope will be many future collaborations.

<em>Edmar: Can you tell me how you first came up with the idea of opening Against the Grain.</em>

Jerry: The conception of opening a new brewery started when I was working at BBC--Bluegrass Brewing Co. The first thing that made me want to open a brewery was the salad bar. The ownership decided that in order to cultivate a younger clientele, they needed to put in a salad bar. It was not even a very good salad bar. It had its own homemade sneeze-guard made with two-by-fours, some plexiglass, and thread. It had a dowel rod holding it up and at anytime it could have slammed shut. And it probably killed one of the geriatric patrons. But even the mix of what was in the salad bar there was some two or three week-old spring mix, and then a gigantic thing of hotel pan garbanzo beans…

Sam: Yeah, chickpeas.

Jerry: And they had genetically engineered carrots that were probably three or four inches in diameter, and they would slice them so one slice of carrot could be your whole meal. But I digress. The thing is it was a terrible salad bar. It was a poor concept and I was embarrassed to even walk by it or be associated with it.

Sam: And the pizza warmer.

Jerry: Aww, fuck! I forgot about the pizza warmer, I took several pictures of the pizza warmer. The pizza is a different story. That's for another day. But the salad bar was the first reason. The second reason: Pirate Hooker Statue. Not being a seafood restaurant or on water, the owners decided the natural choice to bring people into your bar is to put a gigantic pirate hooker statue outside.

Sam: A ceramic whore as a pirate.

<em>Edmar: Now that usually works in a coastal town, like in the Redneck Riviera. The Florida panhandle or maybe parts of Georgia. </em>

Sam: I think it was procured in the Redneck Riviera.

Jerry: This is even worse--it was purchased for $600. When I looked online I discovered that I could have gotten the same pirate statue for $500 new. That's what kind of person, what kind of ownership that we are dealing with here. So that was the last straw. I just could not be associated with a place with a salad bar and a pirate hooker statue. So obviously we were forced into doing Against the Grain.  That's the the long and the short of it.

The on-the-record kind of answer is there was a dissatisfaction with every place that you would go to had a wheat ale, and then a pale ale, and then their stout, and then their amber ale, and then their brown ale. And you would go to a place and they'd go, "oh we have those," and then the specialties. The specialties look good. That's pretty cool because the creativity of the brewer lies in their specialties because it's always rotating and the other normal things are kind of stamped out. But the reality was, "Ya' gotta make another brown ale, gotta make and another brown ale."

We would never taste the wheat beer that we made at BBC because we had made it 300 times. There was no excitement to it. So we were thinking, "what if everything was special?" That's how the concept started. But to give it some parameter we decided to make beers along flavor characteristics. The session beer's parameter only had to be under 5% ABV. It could emphasize anything, hop, malt, smoke, dark, and was a nice one that you could do anything within. Obviously other beers had their own characteristics so you would find a breadth of different things one would be able to drink. We knew what that beer was going to be like, but we didn't exactly know what that beer was yet. So that is kind of how it started.

<a href="http://www.mashtunfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/web_jerry-e1438046722838.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-339" src="http://www.mashtunfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/web_jerry-e1438046722838.jpg" alt="web_jerry" width="550" height="310" /></a>

<em>Edmar: How did all you guys meet each other?</em>

Sam: I was a home brewer and I would send my pregnant wife to Jerry to get grains.

Jerry: She wasn't pregnant when she came the first time?

Sam: I would go badger him for ingredients and one day I happened to come in and say, "Hey, do you need any help?" And he happened to say, "I do need help." And he gave me the shittiest job there. Which was a good job, actually. I enjoyed it. Cleaning kegs, sweeping the floor. It was really a good job because Jerry was never there. So I just kind of worked my way up from that to assistant under him, directly under him.

<em>Edmar: I'll bet it felt great to have Jerry's body on top of you. He is very athletic, you can't see this on the recording but not only is he athletic, he practices gymkata.</em>

Sam: He was doing marathons then, too, so he was very fit.

Jerry: It certainly worked better than vice versa.

<em>Edmar: Well, you would have been crushed by the wheels of industry.</em>

Sam: Yeah, exactly.

Jerry: I didn't say that.

<em>Edmar: So you started working with Jerry over at the BBC and this is one of your cholos, one of your co-workers. Were there other people there who were also working at this particular BBC with you?  </em>

Jerry: Yes there was a man named Shitty Fartson, who is our other partner here.

Sam: Or if you prefer the Asian way of saying it, Shitao Fartyama. Or if maybe he is hailing from, let's say Israel, it's Shitsgavich Fartsgavich. Whichever way you want to angle him, his mother calls him Adam Watson.

<em>Edmar: Was Adam also a brewer?</em>

<a href="http://www.mashtunfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sam-e1438046819214.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-340" src="http://www.mashtunfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sam-e1438046819214.jpg" alt="sam" width="549" height="310" /></a>

Sam: Yeah, he started when Sam moved to the assistant brewer position. Adam filled his void by cleaning kegs and things. And he was going to law school at the time and gaming Thursday nights as well.  Good old Shitty Farts passed the bar and then went to work. He obviously used his tens of thousands of dollars education to continue cleaning kegs and work up to assistant brewer.

<em>Edmar: Isn't that one of the first jobs you get out of law school? </em>

Jerry: Yeah. Either digging ditches or some sort of a housekeeping job.

<em>Edmar: So while you guys were actually talking about this, how did you come up with a name of the brewery?</em>

Jerry: Yeah the name was Grain Palate Overturned, we had to un-sack it all by hand and I thought that Against the Grain would be a good name for it.

<em>Edmar: Great metaphor.</em>

Jerry: Yeah it was something, it was something. So, we just stuck with that from there on out.

<em>Edmar: Now when you were talking about this were you actively looking for places?</em>

Jerry: Sort of. What really accelerated it was when I talked to some people about some rough ideas. We didn't even have a business plan. We had some very loose numbers. And I got a call from a person who said, "This ex-restaurant has just closed down. Would you like to go and look at it? The previous owner is a friend of mine." So we went in there and just thought about it and we talked to the landlord there. We told them our concept and they were like, "You are our first in line. We want this concept. Can you get me your business plan by tomorrow?" So obviously I spent some real hard time that night working on business plan numbers and everything, and I came up with a good four page business plan and they were still interested. They were like, "You guys got it all together." And I was like, "Well, either you are a terrible landlord or…"

<em>Edmar: Desperate.</em>

Jerry: But what really started it in earnest was that we were forced into it, just by that opportunity, to make it happen. By making that business plan we were able to go on from there, revise it, and we ended up telling that person we were not interested in the property. It wouldn't have worked for us in that location. But it got us started along that road and that was the tipping point. And from there we started to talk to people about funding and money. And people start thinking...

<em>Edmar: Like, "Hey, it's real!"</em>

Jerry: Yeah. And now you have this ball rolling when people start giving you checks. Other people could see that you were actually raising money and it got them inclined to invest as well. Right at the turn of the year, December, we were thinking about looking at properties. January 2011 happened and by July we purchased this place. That's how fast it moved.

<em>E: It's really incredible that the trio of the salad bar, the hooker pirate, and a friend who told you that he had a space available for you forced you all to get together to make this plan. How did you negotiate the relationships to be a partners with each other and decide what your roles would be?</em>

<em> </em>Sam: I think we didn't negotiate or talk about what our roles were going to be. We all collectively agreed that we have the same work ethic. That's important. And that our talents would be the heaviest part of us and we would settle into the spot. Which has happened. We have all collectively settled into where we need to be.

Jerry: I think at first it was a lot of people trying to do a lot of different things, and trying to know everything about it, and it wasn't consciously talked about. Everyone just slid into their role.  I don't have a damned clue what's happening with the restaurant, for example. I don't even know when we close at night. [Laughter]. But I do know what's happening in the brewery and I don't expect anybody else to have to know. Of course, we are always open, and if anyone wants to know anything, they can ask, and we can say, "Fuck off, I've got that handled."

<em>E: You know I didn't even think about the restaurant portion of the pub. Who is the guy that runs it? Did you hire a guy or is he one of the guys?</em>

Sam: It was Andrew. Andrew was a server at BBC. One day Adam and Jerry and I were in the brewery whispering about this brewery we were going to open. And we're trying not to tell anyone, because our previous employer was a fucking lunatic and thought we were stealing ourselves from him. Andrew would come in and chitchat with us. He is a likable guy, you know, and he'd come in, and he knew a little bit about plumbing. So Jerry is kind of interrogating him about plumbing, and one day Adam threw it out there and said, "You guys ever consider opening your own brewery?" And sure enough Jerry was: "Well, yeah. Here, read this. You got any money?" He looks at it and is like, "Yeah, this is really good, but you don't have any business end on the restaurant." Andrew is from the Outback/Bonefish family of restauranteurs and had experience opening restaurants.

<em>Edmar: So he had experience as an opener and understood the whole operations end of the restaurant biz. </em>

Jerry: We didn't know that at the time, we just thought he was another shit-ass server. Apparently he was working his way into going back to school to do something different.

Sam: He pulled his weight, so we asked him if he wanted to be a partner, and we had the complete team at that point to do this.

<em>Edmar: Jerry, were you always going to figure out how to start your own place?</em>

Jerry: I knew that there were a lot of headaches coming with the ownership. And I was always a little reticent to go that route. Basically because I didn't have any money. But I also always had this nagging feeling that I can't do this forever. This is a young man's game. Brewing is a young man's game. You saw what we did this morning...

<em>Edmar: Oh yeah, I can't do that forever. I am an old man.</em>

<a href="http://www.mashtunfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Web_takeshi.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-341" src="http://www.mashtunfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Web_takeshi-e1438046857375.jpg" alt="Web_takeshi" width="550" height="364" /></a>

Jerry: I would ask myself, "Am I going to do this until I'm 60? Hump bags of grain and stir a kettle?" Ain't going to happen. So I knew that there was going to be some point where I would have to change what I'm doing. Whether that was getting out of the business or what, I didn't know at that time. But luckily having the people to start this place gave me the vision of how this is going to go in the future. And I wouldn't be able to do it without Shitty Fartson, Cram Jizz, or Main Glue Frawt. So, now I have this idea on how this goes from here on out so I don't have to hump every bag of grain to make good beer. You just need to set people up to do that, and hopefully we are working on that right now. We are transitioning. I do less of the actual brewing, more of the actual planning and things like that, so it's been a different role for me, but it's something that I am learning and I have to do.

<em>Edmar: Well, the interesting thing about this story is that you found this place which used to be called Brownies.</em>

Jerry: Well, they looked like a sinking ship.

<em>Edmar: You could tell it was going down? </em>

Jerry: We came here with the intention to take the equipment.

<em>Edmar: You wanted to just buy all their shit and get out?</em>

Jerry: Yeah. And we were like, "Their fecal matter is not gonna leave."

<em>Edmar: And then they were like, "Please take the entire toilet." So, you made an offer on all of their equipment and they offered you the option to take over their lease and business?</em>

Jerry: That is exactly what happened. We gave them a really fair price and bid on their equipment and they said, "Oh wait that's way too low." Well, obviously it wasn't, but their comeback was, "How 'bout the whole place, then?" And the jumping-off point for their number was very nice.

<em>Edmar: So you took over and how long did it take for you to open?</em>

Jerry: It took until July 29th. We opened Oct. 4th.

<em>Edmar: Holy shit, wow. </em>

Jerry: So that was another real big benefit of purchasing this business. There was no equipment to install, there was no buildout for anything, no need for cleaning or inspections. We just had to focus on dialing in what we wanted to do in brewing, having beer ready, and changing the license. We purchased their assets; we did not purchase their liabilities.

<em>Edmar: So in 2011, when you guys started doing this stuff, did people give a shit, did they care that you guys opened up a new place?</em>

Jerry: They cared a lot, but, you know, there is still a really small segment of really avid craft beer drinkers in this town. You can't sustain what we are doing without having new business as well. So it took a good eight months...  It took a while to cultivate enough restaurant business at six months. It was pretty dicey there the first few months. You had the initial crop of people coming in and drinking. But it took us a good year to feel good about it, feel like, "Hey this is all going to work, we are not going to close." And we could actually continue doing more interesting things that cost money, bringing us to a different place after about a year, I think. And now as more and more people come in, we are more well known around town, people are coming in for the food. The food is really good. So, we have really seen a lot of growth in the last year independent of that first six months.

<em>Edmar: And you are counting on business from the Louisville baseball park having people coming out to drink some beer, eat some food. </em>

<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2015/07/a-conversation-with-jerry-gnagy-and-sam-cruz-of-against-the-grain-brewery/labelart1/" rel="attachment wp-att-610"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-610" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/labelart1-550x364.jpg" alt="labelart1" width="550" height="364" /></a>

Sam: We have two segments that we market in. When I say marketing, for baseball games or for the baseball stadium business, we just open the doors and that's the plan. The doors open, the people come in. If the product is good they keep coming back. The opposite end is focusing on the city and getting out there, and our capture over the last year has been phenomenal. It's been a combination of really doing what we said we wanted to do in the beginning, and that is put beer on the pedestal it should be on. So we have a lot of beer-centric events and a lot of guests come in and do things, and it's all centered around what we do best. And that is make beer.

<em>Edmar: When we first got your beers in our bar in Chicago we had no idea who the fuck you guys were. We tasted your beers, and couldn't believe this beer was being made in Louisville. It was really a treat to get your liquid. And I remember we were driving back from a vacation in the Redneck Rivera and we looked you up and purposely drove here to drink your beer. I don't know how you designed your distribution strategy, but the fact that you all managed to reach outside of Louisville and find a market in Chicago showed me that a small brewery in the middle of the fucking country could compete with every fucking brewery on earth and destroy them.</em>

Sam: Well, that's really what we do. We have distribution in 38 of the 48 contiguous states in the US.

Jerry: You forgot about Alaska.

Sam: That's right, we also have Alaska.

<em>Edmar: The </em>Mash Tun <em>readers in Alaska are going to be so pissed off.</em>

Sam: And then we also have Western Europe. A lot of Western Europe, actually. With the expansion of the new place I think we can add two more global markets pretty quick.

<em>Edmar: Did you consciously decide like to go wide with your beer because you knew that the local market couldn't drink all of it?</em>

Jerry: We are fortunate in a lot of ways. First of all, just being at the right place at the right time. Meeting the right people at the right time. But what I've always thought about local breweries is that everyone always says they want local, but in reality they don't. They want extravagant. They want something no one else has ever had. Because nobody respects you in your hometown. You send it away and if people drink this and it's good, they are like, "What is going on here?" They will write about it, RateBeer about it, BeerAdvocate about it. They will write it in some Mash Tun Magazine or some bullshit like that. Something nobody reads--except in Alaska. And it actually forces the person next door to respect you. Nobody respects the person right next door that is doing great. They don't care about them. But people care if it came from a long distance and if it is exclusive. It helps to have good things out and then let it come back to you. It was a very different way to think about it.

<em>Edmar: Did you know this in advance? </em>

Jerry: It was kind of a theory.

<em>Edmar: Well, I guess you proved it.</em>

Jerry: Well, again, it was also a lot of good circumstances at the time. Let's talk about our relationship with River North. It was a big example of a way to sell your beer away. The people from River North came to Kentucky to visit another brewery called Alltech (The makers of Kentucky Bourbon Ales) and learn about their beers. I don't know who called them, but someone told them you need to stop by Against the Grain. And they stopped by. They tried the beer, they liked the place, we talked to them. And they said, "Why don't you put some stuff on a pallet?" and that is how it started. And it just kept going from there. But that was when they didn't have the Shelton Brothers portfolio. I talked to another guy at River North. He said, "You were one of the cornerstones of when we started doing more craft. One of the other things is that everyone is using the sales guys that have every craft brand. Like Windy City or Louis Glunz. We were like, "Let's not, we would be lost in a sea of brands." Let's go with the Anheuser-Busch guy and be one of their six. It made sense for us at the time. It apparently made sense, I guess. It's just how things worked. [<em>Editor's note: River North has since become Lakeshore Beverage</em>.]

<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2015/07/a-conversation-with-jerry-gnagy-and-sam-cruz-of-against-the-grain-brewery/labelart2/" rel="attachment wp-att-612"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-612" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/labelart2-550x364.jpg" alt="labelart2" width="550" height="364" />
</a>

<em>Edmar: Through that random encounter you made ties to Chicago. You guys have worked with a number of people there: from the cats at Local Option, multiple chefs, that amazing place in Berwyn, Cigars &amp; Stripes, the Aviary, and even us guys from Marz. How do you make these decisions on who to collaborate with?</em>

Sam: It has to make sense for both of us. We don't expect to make a collaboration beer with Lagunitas, you know? It doesn't make sense for them to make ATG beer or us to make Lagunitas beer. We have to have a similar trajectory and also have similar interests. Maybe similar idiosyncrasies and then when we combine the brands they will be a little bit more as opposed to one dwarfing the other. They both shine through. So I think that is a part of it.

<em>Edmar: A true collaborative spirit. </em>

<em> </em>Jerry: It's one of those things. But another part is we just like the people we work with. And that has a lot to do with it too. But we are also one of the few places where there is no limit. There is no limit to what we will try. A lot of places are not going to take a risk.

<em>Edmar: Including your extensive list of collaborations you have also managed to kick out how many different brews to this day?</em>

<em> </em>Jerry: You know, I have lost count. But I know it's probably 260 beers since we have started. 200 are unique.

<em>Edmar: So over 75% of your beers are unique and primarily distributed though Twelve Percent?</em>

Jerry: Yes, that just started in 2014. In the past everything we brewed also had a portion distributed. We couldn't sustain that with our growth, so we decided we are going to do more regular brands for distribution with some specialty thrown in. And then we will use the current system just to fill our tanks for the brewpub and let that be a very unique beer here. People will have to come here to get some of the brewpub-exclusive beers.

<em>Edmar: Great idea. In fact you guys just opened an expansion brewery. Was this part of the plan?</em>

<em> </em>Jerry: Yeah, exactly. Well, it's just another one of those things. "Let's start thinking about it." Two months later, we've bought a building. [Laughter]. You have to be very, very careful what you think about. This shit comes true real quick.

Sam: I remember January was funny, "Let's start thinking about what the numbers are like." I look on the internet for real estate listings. And in March I guess we are opening a brewery. Got a building, got everything we need.

<a href="http://www.mashtunfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sassys-e1438046940272.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-342" src="http://www.mashtunfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sassys-768x1024.jpg" alt="sassys" width="518" height="690" /></a>

<em> Edmar: There are a bunch of breweries expanding lately. And you guys are moving to a pretty close part of town. Breweries in Chicago are doing the same thing. Half Acre is expanding. Obviously Lagunitas built a huge facility in Chicago. Our local faves Pipeworks just signed a long-term lease right by the cholos at Off Color. With that said, you've heard the arguments about this notion of the second bubble for craft beer. I think it is a bunch of bullshit because this is a different era, different audience, different generation of people that actually want flavorful, unique, weirdo shit. Or people want something good to drink as opposed to the garbage of the mainstream beers. </em>

Sam: I think we have multiple things working in our favor for this. One being that we produce great beer. I know that, you know that, we all know that. That is what we want to do no matter the cost. We are never going to stop producing quality beer. Beyond that we are very conservative with our growth, believe it or not. We don't take big chances. As wild as we may seem, everything makes sense financially. The brewery that we are building would be fine to stay closed any amount of time as long as we continue to operate as we have, business as usual. So it's really something that makes sense financially. I think that's why its a safe bet.

<em>Edmar: So what is your strategy with this production brewery?</em>

<em> </em>Sam: Well, right now we are a few drops of liquid in an ocean of beer. We are going to produce 10,000 bbls to start. Never going beyond 70,000 in that spot. It just can't physically hold the tank space for that 70,000 barrels. So with all the markets that we have touched down in and put a trickle of beer in it would only be maybe adding a few more drops to those markets and keep people aware that you know we still exist. I think it isn't necessarily our intention to revolutionize beer in Portland, Oregon. But to have a long-sustaining business in Louisville that can support not only my partners and I but also the network of employees that we have created. And, then, also allow us to pursue some of the other things we want to do. I know collectively we want to leave Louisville in a better place than we found it, and our intention is to do that with some of the success we have.

<em>Edmar: That's awesome. Yeah, building this kind of endeavor affects, like you said, your employees, so many different people. It's intense how responsible you are for a large community and their families and their livelihood, really. </em>

<em> </em>Sam: We employ 54 people right now. And you know I can say that it is a regular thing for me to think about those 54 people and I want to see them do well.

Jerry: Whereas I could give a fuck about them.

Sam: He doesn't even know who they are.

<em>Edmar: Could you speak about the role the brewery has in transforming your neighborhood? You have participated in the growth and development of industry here in Louisville. Do you think that the city will continue to attract more people, more business, more activity?</em>

<em> </em>Jerry: I think so.

Sam: Over the last 10 years this place has changed dramatically. You can see a lot of the projects coming to fruition, while some go away. I think we reinvigorated the park, so of speak. The baseball stadium was pretty stagnant. They wanted to redo it anyway. They wanted to pump money into here but we reinvigorated the good times. Before we opened it was a place to bring your kids to the ballpark, watch the game, and get out of here. Now people are interested in what's going on at Against the Grain. And it shows in our business, you can see the growth there. As far as setting this corner of downtown into a good spot, we have done that as well. I think it helped the businesses down the road a little bit. Most importantly I feel like we were a springboard for other entrepreneurs that want to start breweries or get into the beer business. I feel like our successes have been an example to other people that they can do this as well.

Edmar: I always ask brewers I interview to offer advice. Jerry, you mentioned you never really thought about owning a brewery just five years ago. What are some things you have learned that have gone beyond being a brewmaster in someone else's brewery. What kind of advice do you give to people who have liquid dreams?

Jerry: I just think you have to put it down on paper. If it makes sense on paper it will make sense in the real world. Don't fool yourself on things, just be realistic about it. Number one, make good product. Number two, make it interesting for yourself. If it's interesting for yourself it will be interesting for other people out there. And that is some of the best advice I would suggest. Make good beer, have fun with it. If you are actually having fun with what you are doing it will shine through. How you market it, what you're selling will all come to fruition. People can see that.

Sam: I have two pieces. One is don't be afraid to change. If you realize something isn't working there is nothing wrong with finding something that works. You just can't be afraid of that. Also, realize you don't know anything. You are not the end-all. Respect yourself and realize you probably know more than others, but you don't know everything. So, again, don't be afraid to change and don't be afraid to surround yourself with people who do know. I think that is very important as well.

<em>E: Right on.</em>

<em> </em>S: Listen to everybody. Everybody has an idea.
