In the spring of 1991, I went to school in a tony French university town called Aix-en Provence. Here, I became friends with a bunch of Dutch cholos, among them Patrick Hendrikse. After the semester ended, he and I enjoyed a debaucherous couple of weeks while I stayed with him in Haarlem, NL. He introduced me to schwarma and bought me my first Belgian Beer, a Duvel tripel.  Over the decades we have remained great friends and frequent visitors. In the 90s he opened up his first place, the Bar Tabac, with his friend Bart Obertop in Amsterdam.  By the turn of the century, he and Bart became some of the most successful restaurateurs and bar owners in the city and it has been a delight to watch what they were up to.  I make it a point to visit him almost every year while traveling with art shows, visiting festivals, and keeping dreams alive of moving there someday. In 2008, Patrick and Bart took over the legendary, Brouwerij 't IJ (pronounced "Browerie EYE"). It sits under the only remaining 17th century windmill in the city of Amsterdam. The brewery’s award winning Belgian style beers have been local heroes since the 80s. It was founded by Kaspar Peterson, a onetime Dutch singer/songwriter who opened the brewery in the heyday of the 80s alternative music and art scene. The story goes that Kaspar opened the Brouwerij 't IJ to show the Belgians that the Dutch know how to make great beer as well.

When we opened Maria's Packaged Goods &amp; Community Bar in 2010, Patrick told me that I should have done it a long time ago. And I told him that he needed to get his beer over to the states because it was so good.  When he and Bart visited Chicago a few years back, we would talk a lot about future beer plans. They were some of the few people to tell us that it was a good idea to open up a brewery. While here, we gave them a tour of our favorite breweries: Half Acre, Three Floyd's, New Glarus and Revolution, hoping to nudge them toward expanded operations.

I was in Amsterdam last February as a guest of honor for the opening of their new production brewery. I performed as Reverend Edmar, sang a cover version of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Power of Love, and did a ceremony with Patrick and Bart to bless their brewery. It was a beautiful thing. I took the opportunity to ask them a few questions one night over Spanish cuisine at some nice place in the Red Light District.

<strong>Ed</strong>: Why get involved with the brewing industry?

<strong>Patrick:</strong> We had been living in Amsterdam for a long time, and every time we visited Brouwerij ‘t IJ, we had a great time. And the beer was always the same, it didn't go with trends, it just was what it was. We were also fed up with our own successful bars and thought we should change it up and go with this brewery that has this real authenticity to it.

<strong>Bart</strong>: And the making aspect also appealed to us, creating a product, producing and manufacturing.
Was it a normal progression? I remember you guys appreciated the brewery and the founder Kaspar Peterson, so it didn't seem like a big stretch to take it over.

<strong>Pat</strong>: No. Everyone thought we were crazy.

<strong>Bart</strong>:  Because we had no idea about the brewing business, and they said, "What are you doing?!" Kaspar made us work in the brewery for a year and a half.

<strong>Ed:</strong> Didn’t you have a rocky start?

<strong>Bart</strong>: At first he was up for selling it to us, so we started to raise money to buy it. But then he changed his mind and decided he wanted to expand it instead. We said our congratulations and just went on with life.

<strong>Pat</strong>: I remember we went to the reopening of the brewpub and we were standing maybe five meters from the bar. We had the money, but not the brewery. For years we would still drink over there, saying to ourselves that it was such a shame that we didn't go through with it; we were nearly there.

<strong>Bart</strong>: I saw Kaspar at the reopening of the brewpub and I shook his hand and said congratulations...

<strong>Pat</strong>: We told him it looked great. And then he said, ‘Good to see you guys when do you guys want to meet? I'm done here...

<strong>Bart</strong>: ...and I need a new manager, and we can start thinking about you buying the place by having you work here.’ So the next Monday we started working there. I went to the garden store to get some rubber boots, and had no idea what would happen next.
Jesus Christ. Well obviously you guys know a lot now. What were the biggest issues you had to deal with when you first started?

<strong>Bart</strong>: The technical problems were new to us.

<strong>Pat</strong>: Normally, we solved technical problems by phoning people to fix them. Now we have to solve everything ourselves inside the brewery.

<strong>Bart</strong>:  But the biggest problem was to get the work atmosphere right. For the people that had been working there a long time, the changes and new faces were a bit of a shock. Our introduction was, ‘Hello, this is Bart and Patrick. They are your new trainees, and your new managers and they are going to buy the place.’ So everybody was like ‘What the fuck?  They are going to buy the place?’ Nobody was cooperating, everybody hated us from scratch.

<strong>Ed</strong>: How did you resolve that?

<strong>Bart</strong>: By just working hard, because in the beginning we didn’t realize how complicated it was to brew beer. When you realize that you don't start a project like this.

<strong>Patrick</strong>: We were not confrontational. We were in a good spot and some of them weren't so much. We had half a dozen successful bars/restaurants. They were probably thinking ‘What are these guys going to do with the brewery? Are they going to turn it into a steakhouse?’  Of course we weren't going to do that. They were scared for their brewery so we needed to explain that to them and remain friendly.

<strong>Bart</strong>: We put a lot of emphasis on not changing a thing.  ‘Change’ was always the wrong word. So no ‘change,’ and gradually we could turn fear into trust.

<strong>Ed:</strong> When did you guys realize that you guys were part of this global phenomenon of people making good beer? Did you guys even know that your beer was some of the best liquid in the world?

<strong>Bart</strong>: No, we were not aware.

<strong>Patrick</strong>: At first we were just local guys brewing beer, and then realized there were more guys doing this. I mean of course we knew that, but then at one point we thought, ‘This is great, we are part of this movement.’
<strong>
Ed:</strong> Well I remember you guys came over and we toured Chicago breweries, I think you had a good time, right?

<strong>Bart</strong>: We had a brilliant time, and our eyes opened up while we were in the States. And we decided to get things moving forward with a different approach.

<strong>Ed:</strong> Explain that, what do you think the difference is?

<strong>Bart</strong>: In the States you don't have to be a third generation brewer to make good beer. To lots of Belgians you are never good enough, you have to be a family brewer to gain their respect.

<strong>Ed:</strong> Yeah, they want you to train forever, you have to apprentice with a family brewery and you are not allowed to brew unless you've worked with a master brewer shoveling grain for 16 years before you get a chance, right?

<strong>Patrick</strong>: To the Yankees, making beer is a fun thing to do, it's like, ‘Hey, uh, I have this great idea, I'm going to make some raspberry beer. Uh what? I don't like it, but someone else does. Okay I'm just going make it.’ I'm not a big fan of some of the crazy experimental stuff, but I like the idea of having fun and making beer as you go along. When the American brewers we saw succeeded they said ‘Hey, this works so I'm going to expand.’ and so that's what we did, we expanded.

<strong>Ed:</strong> Did people say you were crazy doing the expansion?

<strong>Patrick</strong>: Not so much, microbrewing has grown here, but nothing like in America. People here still really like their pilsner, Heineken, Amstel and stuff like that.

<strong>Ed:</strong> What is your approach towards designing beer styles for your audience here in Holland?

<strong>Bart</strong>: We have always been like a Belgian style brewery. Since a little while ago, maybe since our trip to Chicago, we also expanded the style of beers to bitter beers with bitter hops, IPA kind of American styles.

<strong>Ed:</strong> Do people like that style of beer in Amsterdam?

<strong>Patrick</strong>: It's surprising how quickly they pick up.  However here they call an IPA an ‘eepa’ because they see the word, we say oh it’s ‘I.P.A.’ Then, ‘That doesn't make sense, I.P.A., why would you say that?” and then we say ‘Oh, India Pale Ale.’ ‘What the hell is that?’ Because they don't know what an ale is or a pale ale is and for sure they don't know what an India Pale Ale is because it's an Anglo Saxon tradition that we don't have. So we have to explain the story, but even if you don't know the story, that's not even important because they say, "Hey man, I had that eepa, great beer, great beer! Great beer, I'll have another one!" And they love it.

<strong>Bart</strong>: They like the citrusy stuff and the bitterness and the dryness. But it can't be too sweet. Here pilsners and the smoothest Belgian styles of beer appeal to people.

<strong>Patrick</strong>: And people who normally drink pilsner beers also enjoy the eepa.

<strong>Ed:</strong> So are you guys going to bring out more American and British styles, in addition to your IPAs?

<strong>Patrick</strong>: We really like stouts, so we might move into that category as well. Now that we have expanded it’s easier for us to do something different that our usual line up. Before, we were not able to do anything out of the ordinary, because the demand for our beer was too high.

<strong>Ed</strong>: You couldn't make enough beer to fulfill demand. I remember that.

<strong>Patrick</strong>: In the past few years our patrons didn't really appreciating us freaking around because they wanted their normal dose of beer. If you waste brew space by freaking around, then you are going to have less normal beer.

<strong>Ed:</strong> Now that there is room, what about collaborations? You are going to work with most of the people you know, that you like around here right?

<strong>Bart</strong>: We have identified what we are developing and many brewers we know have the same kind of brewing equipment that we have so it will be interesting to do a collaboration.
<strong>
Ed:</strong> Who else would you make beers with right now if you could?

<strong>Patrick</strong>: Uh the Three Floyd’s fuckers, those Indiana guys, and the Bridgeport Marszewski family, of course.

<strong>Ed:</strong> So your plans for this next year are to ramp up your production, scale up your production, distribution, experiment more… I don't know if this is true or not but I heard you guys are starting your own beer festival, the Amsterdam Beer Festival. What do you see happening in your world like in the next few years?

<strong>Patrick</strong>: I am a lame guy, I just plan a month ahead, so I think we are going to do a whole bunch of stuff, but what it is exactly I don't know.

<strong>Bart</strong>: A good beer festival is always nice.

<strong>Ed</strong>:Thanks guys.
