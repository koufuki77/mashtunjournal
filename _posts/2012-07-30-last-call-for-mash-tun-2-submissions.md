You have a few days left for your pitch. If you are interested in contributing to <em>Mash Tun</em>, please send us a one paragraph pitch. <em><strong>Send it to edmarlumpen at gmail.com</strong></em>. Enclose some writing samples and/or links to your other work. Our deadline for proposals is August 1, 2012. And we will need texts by August 21, 2012. We are looking for historical essays, interviews with figures in the industry, reports from different cities on where to find the good stuff as well as essays on the art of beer. We are also inaugurating a craft spirits section to cover small batch distilleries as well. We will release issue 2 on October 5, 2012 during the Mash Tun Oktoberfest event at the Bridgeport Art Center.
