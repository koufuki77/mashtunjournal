<strong>We found some great news about one of our favorite breweries.. </strong><strong><a href="http://beerpulse.com/2012/06/surly-brewings-ansari-on-possible-minneapolis-spot-for-new-brewery/">
REBLOG FROM BEERPULSE</a></strong>

(Brooklyn Center, MN) – <strong>Surly Brewing</strong> Founder and Owner, Omar Ansari, and Head Brewer, Todd Haug, did a talk at last weekend’s SAVOR event. The biggest revelation from Ansari…

<em>“We have a meeting next week to hopefully nail down a 8.5-acre spot in the middle of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area real close to [the University of Minnesota]. The idea is to bring Linda [Haug] on and have her handle the food component. [The facility will have] a 100-150 seat restaurant, 300-seat beer hall and a two-acre beer garden. [...] We ordered a German 100-barrel Rolec system that should be showing up January, 2014.”</em>

Any ties to U of M? Ansari <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/print-edition/2011/07/15/omar-ansari---surly-brewing-co.html?page=all">donated $50,000</a> to the university last year though he graduated from Macalester.

Ansari did not reply to a request for more details on the property or the meeting that would have taken place this week. The company has been working with TEGRA Group to help facilitate landing a spot for nearly ten months. Once the company has found a spot, it will begin to create what it announced in February of last year, <a href="http://beerpulse.com/2011/02/surly-brewing-plans-for-new-20-million-brewery/">a $20 million destination brewery</a>.

In other news…

- They are adding six more fermenters to the existing facility this month and that will be it for the current space

- The reason Haug may be able to <a href="http://beerpulse.com/2012/05/surly-pentagram-to-hopefully-become-annual-bottle-release/">make Pentagram an annual release</a> is because he has dedicated a 60-barrel fermenter to only Brett beers.

- The audio is <a href="http://www.craftbeerradio.com/node/1471">here</a>. The guys discuss the anniversary releases, Furious, Darkness and the whole shebang over the course of the 73-minute talk.

- Bonus: someone made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC3xvkQ4Vuw" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-48563];player=swf;width=640;height=385;">90-second song</a> based on Furious.
