Once every few months or so, If I'm lucky, I see a gathering of what I call The Beer Buyer's Club at my bar in the south side of Chicago.  These ladies are some of the few women of influence in the Chicago Beer industry, and it's great to see them all in one place. It's usually a Friday afternoon and I walk up to these cholos and say the same thing. "What the hell are you guys doing here? Slumming?

These ladies are all members of the Illuminati of the Chicago beer industry: They are Sellers and Buyers of Beer. They are tastemakers and industry insiders and often determine the allocation lists of the world’s most coveted beers. They decide what you get to drink at yer local watering hole by offering their beers for sale to retailers and if you play nice you get the good shit.
Few of you will ever get to know these women, but all of  us in Chicago are affected by their decisions. One of the cats in this secret club is Ria Neri. She knows how to play nice, and she is an inspiration to us at <em>Mash Tun Journa</em>l. I've known Ria for a while now and she inhabits the same neighborhood as me, Bridgeport, the Community of the Future. We don’t see each other enough, but that's because she is super busy being the Beer Buyer for some of Chicago's most celebrated restaurants and bars: Bangers &amp; Lace, Trenchermen, Lone Wolf and Nightwood. I bugged Ria at one of those ad hoc meetings and asked her to just answer a few questions to inspire people working in the industry. She agreed.
Ed: What was your first hospitality job? And how did that go?

Ria: Nightwood Restaurant in Pilsen.  I was a barback.  It was my kind of gig.  Working behind the scenes allowed me a glimpse of the madness (the fun kind) that is the hospitality industry.

EM: I remember you telling me that you and Kevin Heisner used to brew shit tons of beer. When did you first start getting into beer? When was that first brew day, what did you make?

RN: S*#T tons! (I don’t swear).  I had expressed a desire for a new hobby, so my good friend Kevin got me a Beer brewing kit- not just one, but six kits.  On the first brew day, Kevin decided he wanted to make all six beers in one day.  I agreed.  We went for it.  We were clueless.  And the hot water went out.  It was a mess.  We ended up with two brews --  a Wit and a Stout -- and a whole new respect for beer brewing.

EM: How do you decide on a concept for a beverage program? Do you have a methodology for choosing beers and beverages for the places you manage?

RN: The concept is always determined along with the restaurant/bar as a whole.  I find that it is almost always an organic process.  In the end, I always strive for balance.

EM: I often hear about how horrible bar owners and buyers are to distributors and reps of beer companies, and it is startling. But sometimes distributors won't allocate or give access to rare beers. How do you deal with a distributor that does not give you product you want to present to your patrons? Especially when another bar down the block gets it.

RN: A mutual respect &amp; understanding is required here.  It’s not personal.  It’s beer, and there’s s*#t tons of it!  S*#t tons!

EM: What are some of the most important things you have learned working in the industry?

RN: Cutthroat competition has no value.  The desire to be the Ace of Spades will get you lost in the shuffle.  Essentially, a deck is worthless when it’s missing a few cards.  I think collaboration and a sense of community are prerequisites to a thriving industry.  Also, I think the industry platform is a fantastic vehicle for sharing knowledge.  Be a source of inspiration, get inspired, and don’t forget to have fun.

EM: I think that Chicagoland might be headed for large-format craft beer bottle fatigue. It's hard to find shelf space for all the small guys. What are your thoughts about the explosion of breweries and brands coming to the Chicago market? How do you choose to support new kids on the block?

RN: Viewing the explosion of the craft beer movement with a positive outlook is an attitude that needs to be practiced on a daily basis.  As a beer buyer, do I feel overwhelmed at times? Absolutely.  Do the products I am presented with always taste up to par- (subjectively)?  Most of the time, but not always.  Do I think these eager new players have longevity?  I hope so.
The forecast of a looming collapse in the craft beer movement is an image I prefer not to fixate on.  I readily adopt this craft beer explosion with a sense of optimism, perhaps one might say with a bit of naiveté, but I do see an outcome that allows for more creativity, a push towards more innovation, in order to stay afloat.

More importantly, it strengthens a craft brewer’s ingenuity and resourcefulness --  almost requiring an “outside the box thinking” --  and being artists that they are, I can only look forward with great anticipation to the craft that can only be accomplished by the best of them. Besides that, I think the movement allows for more exposure to a mass audience, who probably never considered that “craft beer” a common household term. In the near future, we could see barrel-aged sours pop up at family dinners.

EM: What advice do you have for people interested in getting into the hospitality industry and how would you suggest they are able to attain a position of beverage director?

RN: I think getting into any industry requires a vast curiosity.  Read often, taste often, listen, learn from your peers an don’t be an asshole. There is always much more to know.  It never stops. As Eleanor Roosevelt said:  “Do the things that interest you and do them with all your heart….We can only grow as long as we are interested.”
