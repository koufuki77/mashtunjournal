<em>By Dave Kahle ( from Issue 2 )</em>

With over 2100 breweries in the US and another 1200+ in the process of opening, a common question these days is: “When will we reach a saturation point?” The difficult part of the equation is that the saturation point is a moving target. As more people turn to craft beer, that point increases with them.
The problem with so many brands and choices is that many of them don't move off the shelf fast enough. Presumably, this is the definition of a saturation point. Many of the beer stores and bars try to create an identity by carrying as many different beers as possible. It sounds great in theory, but not in practice, as a number of the beers will collect dust and eventually be too stale to enjoy.

&nbsp;

The larger regional breweries have the cash to hire sales staff that not only help to push their beers, but can pull old beer before it's sold. Smaller breweries don't have this luxury, and even those that do have their staffs stretched thin. Those larger regionals also have more visibility as they make enough beer to distribute in several dozen states. Regional breweries that currently make over 100,000 barrels per year are likely to distance themselves further from the smaller craft brewers as this wave of new breweries fights for the consumers’ attention. In fact, it's already true that most of the beer sold in our country is made by a couple of macro lager breweries and a small percentage of the craft breweries make the majority of the craft beer.

&nbsp;

So what's wrong with old beer? Old beer won't make you sick, it just tastes bad. Most craft breweries consider their beer to be in good condition anywhere from 3-6 months after packaging. What they don't tell you is that these terms apply only when the beer is handled properly. This means constant refrigeration, storage out of direct light, and shipping with minimal agitation from brewery to distributor to retailer to place of consumption. The hardest part is keeping the beer cold. Many breweries don't ship their beer in refrigerated trucks, most distributors have limited refrigerated storage, if they have any at all, and most retailers have limited cold storage and sell most of the beer warm from a shelf.

&nbsp;

Oxidation happens much faster at higher temperatures. In fact, according to the Arrhenius equation, the rate of a chemical reaction doubles with every 10 degrees Celsius increase in temperature. With this in mind, if the maximum amount of time for a craft beer to remain fresh under refrigeration is 6 months, then the same beer at 75 degrees F, might only be fresh for 2 months.

&nbsp;

The flavors of oxidation in beer are papery, wet cardboard, tomato, molasses, black current (ribes), grape candy, honey, leather, sherry and vinous. The last four of these might be considered a good trait in a purposely aged beer. Some people like to age beer that has a high alcohol content (&gt;8% ABV) or has roasted or sour flavors. These stronger flavor profiles will often mask some oxidative flavors while time will reduce hop bitterness, adding to the appeal of some styles like barleywine or imperial stout. Darker beers will also benefit a small amount from antioxidants found in dark malts, however, cellaring beer is not always successful and the likability of aged beers is quite subjective. The papery, wet cardboard flavors come from a compound called E-2-Nonenal (Trans-2-Nonenal). This is primarily from oxidation of fatty acids in beer. Less assertive beer styles have a tough time hiding these flavors, so light lagers and pale/amber ales are often the victims of Nonenal.

&nbsp;

Highly hopped beers, while having the ability to mask some flaws, will take a turn for the worse more rapidly then other styles. With time, hop bitterness decreases, can become harsh, and hop aromatics, which are quite volatile, will dissipate. Russian River and Stone breweries will note on some of their well-hopped beers that aging is not appropriate. In fact, Stone recently released a beer with the “best by” date as its name. Hopefully more breweries will follow their lead. Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, Oskar Blues and Lagunitas have all begun the process of opening additional facilities in hopes of delivering fresher beer to Central and East coast markets. Of course they are all saving money on fuel and shipping costs, but better beer quality is another good reason for the new brewhouses.

&nbsp;

To be clear, we aren't discussing spoiled or contamined beer, "since brewers can now largely control biological instability, it is probably flavor instability that determines the shelf-life of the product." (Bamforth)<a href="#_msocom_1">[smd1]</a> . Many will point to alcohol levels, PH, hop acids or pasteurization as stabilizing factors in beer, and they are, but these help to restrain or eliminate microbiological beer spoilers and have little to contribute in curbing oxidation problems. In fact, pasteurization will increase oxidative staling effects by heating the beer; additionally, the lower the PH, the higher the rate of staling. Hop resins "afford anti-microbial properties and foam stabilization but also comprise precursors of staling and of the skunky aromas that develop in beer exposed to light" (Briggs<a href="#_msocom_2">[smd2]</a> ). Bottle conditioning, on the other hand, can help to scavenge oxygen and extend the flavor stability. It will also naturally carbonate the beer. Bottle conditioning consists of adding a small amount of yeast and often, sugar, to the beer just prior to packaging. It is primarily seen in large format bottles, but some breweries will condition all sizes. Sierra Nevada is well known for bottle conditioning with a barely visible amount of yeast in all of their bottled ales.

&nbsp;

Date codes are inconsistent and often hard to decipher. Many breweries use the Julian calendar to indicate what day of the year the beer was packaged. You might see a series of numbers on the bottle around the neck or the base; the first number might indicate the last digit of the year, while the next three digits are the Julian date. Sometimes you'll find that the first three numbers are the Julian date. And fortunately, you will often see a clearly stamped "bottled on" date in this form: 9/4/12. Other times you might find a "best by" date instead. Some regulation or standardization of date codes is necessary. If you could clearly find the bottled on date, the brewery could still stamp it with all of the other necessary codes it needs to indicate at what time, place, bottling line, etc., the beer was packaged. What if milk was sold with a hard-to-decipher date code? Obviously, old milk can make you sick, while old beer shouldn't, but you get the point. The consumer should know what they're buying.

&nbsp;

Since shipping is harmful to beer flavor, you might want to look for beer that was never shipped in the first place. By this, I mean buy beer directly from your local brewpub or brewery. If the laws allow it, buy a growler of beer that just finished conditioning in the last day or two. If you can't get to the brewery, look for local beer at the store; it's often some of the freshest brew in the house. This is always a rule of thumb to follow when traveling, too.

&nbsp;

Back to the original point: with so many beer choices, and saturation in some markets, you are likely to buy beer that isn't fresh or maybe you get suckered into buying too much beer at once. You wanted to try so many new beers at once that half of your fridge is full of out-of-date beer. What can we do as a consumer? Look for date codes and shop at stores that move beer quickly (this often doesn't mean the store with the biggest selection). While perusing the aisles, ask the staff what's freshest, but don't over buy and look for beer that has been bottle conditioned. Definitely buy local and as with produce, shop for beer that’s in season rather than going for a specific style to ensure unpolluted flavor. Choice is great, but I choose beer that tastes like the brewer intended it. Fresh.
