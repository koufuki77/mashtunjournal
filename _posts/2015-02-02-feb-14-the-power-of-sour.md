<strong>Marz Community Brewing Co presents: The Power of Sour</strong>

<strong> Feb 14, 2015 4-8pm
</strong>
<a href="http://www.westernexhibitions.com/" target="_blank">Western Exhibitions</a> â€¢ 845 W Washington Blvd. 2nd Floor Chicago, IL 60607

<a href="http://www.marzbrewing.com" target="_blank">Marz Community Brewing</a> is excited to bring you an anti-Valentines Day event on Sunday, February 14th at Western Exhibitions.

We have been dying to do an Art of Marz Brewing event with Paul Nudd, one of our favorite painters, trouble makers and friends along with his gallery, Western Exhibitions. Paul made the painting of the "Bubbly Creek" monster which adorns our Bubbly Creek Berliner Weiss bottles. For this event we are releasing a limited edition four color silk screened print made especially for this Power of Sour event. And Paul's work will also be on view.

To enjoy Paul's art Marz will be sampling out our expanding line of South Side Sours. Our sour ales are made with a strain of Lactobacillus plantarum discovered by Marz Brewer, Al Robertson, and isolated by Omega Yeast labs. It's our secret weapon in converting beer drinkers to a style of sour ales that are tart, mildly acidic, delicious and made here in Chicago.

During the Power of Sour event we will provide complementary pours of our Bubbly Creek Berliner Weiss, The Duchess de Bridgeport sour brown ale and our brand spanking new Gose style beer called Ruby's Tears. Sampling glasses will be provided by our sister project, Mash Tun Journal.

A suggested donation of $15 will get you one of the prints made by Paul. If you want to guarantee you will receive one of the edition of 100 or so prints you must purchase Admission online at EventBrite. The link is below :
