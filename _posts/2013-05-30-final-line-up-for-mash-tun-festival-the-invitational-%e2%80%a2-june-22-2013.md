The third edition of the Mash Tun Festival  takes  place <strong>June 22th, 2-6pm, 2013 </strong>in Bridgeport, the Community of the Future.

The festival features over thirty of the world’s best breweries pouring over sixty six different brews. Flagship and rare beers will be poured alongside one-of-a-kind concoctions at the stunning <a href="http://bridgeportart.com/">Bridgeport Art Center</a> at 35th and Racine. The festival will be held in the 19th century atrium and the Center’s lovely sculpture garden. Local chefs and food trucks will be vending. Craft spirits and wineries will also be sampling their wares and you will help decide which brewery will win an award for making the best beer.

We are hosting an awards ceremony this year and will be giving out  awards to brewers that make the best liquid in these categories:

Hopped and Confused

Every Day is Like Sunday
WTF Is This
