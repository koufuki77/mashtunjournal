In  issue 10 of <a href="http://underthecounterculture.bigcartel.com/product/mash-tun-10"><em>Mash Tun Journal</em></a>, we celebrate one of the reasons we love craft beer so much: the art and design of beer. Whether you know it or not, your local bottle shop or liquor store is hosting an exhibition of contemporary art on its shelves and in its coolers right now. Beer packaging design and labels are canvases that express the essence of their contents. Like any group art show, some work is pedestrian; some work is extraordinary.

<em>See <a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2016/11/best-looking-brands-in-beer-part-1-mikkeller/">Part 1 of the  Best Looking Brands in Beer</a> for the full introduction.</em>

<strong><em>Evil Twin</em></strong>

If you don’t know Evil Twin Brewing by now, you have been living under a rock. Evil Twin is a Copenhagen-based gypsy brewery that was formed in 2010 by Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergsø. Jeppe’s foray into beer started in the mid 2000s with a beer club and beer store in Copenhagen. Jeppe also happens to be the twin brother of Mikkel Borg Bjergsø, who runs the Danish brewery Mikkeller, whose brand is also featured in our Best Looking Beers in the Business piece.

&nbsp;

Evil Twin started a few years after Mikkel opened Mikkeller in Denmark. As the Danish beer scene blew up and went global, Jeppe made the move to Brooklyn in 2012 to direct his empire. After moving to Brooklyn, he opened an awesome beer bar, Tørst, which features Evil Twin beers alongside other weird and delicious beers from around the world.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

With beers being made on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, Evil Twin has grown into a global craft beer company. He is the living incarnation of the brewer-as-rockstar, jet-setting around the world collaborating, brewing, and innovating for the craft beer world in terms of formula, design, marketing, and distribution.

&nbsp;

Evil Twin is known for their elegant label design and clever beer names, such as: Beer Geek Breakfast, Christmas Eve at a New York City Hotel Room, Imperial Biscotti Break, and Hipster Ale. Jeppe often collaborates with his wife, Maria, who has a hand in guiding the brand through the beer naming and label copy writing processes. Creative Director Martin Justesen initiated the Evil Twin graphic design style with a simple triangle. This triangle is the DNA Martin instilled in the Evil Twin brand, and is a point of reference in the art development for each beer. Martin’s process begins with a beer name. He then creates ideas and sketches from scratch. His work is eye-catching and detail-oriented.

Half Acre Beer Co

&nbsp;

Here in Chicago, we love the design of the liquid and labels of Half Acre Brewing. They were part of the second wave of breweries in Chicago that started breaking the mold of what a brewery could be.

&nbsp;

Half Acre began ten years ago as a contract brewer, and over the last decade they have grown into becoming a Chicago powerhouse. Their first brewery was built in 2008 at 4257 N. Lincoln Ave, which now houses a retail shop, a taproom and full-service kitchen, and a 25-barrel brewhouse.

&nbsp;

Last year, they built their Balmoral Ave. brewery, and it’s about to be unleashed to the public. The larger brewing facility will be complemented by an awesome patio and tasting room—and more food, we hope.

&nbsp;

Well crafted, creative, and classic, Half Acre’s beers are batting 1.000. You will taste magic in their iconic Daisy Cutter Pale Ale, seasonals Akari Shogun American Wheat Ale and GoneAway IPA, freak-out-and-line-up-for-it Big Hugs Imperial Stout with coffee, and other tasty taproom exclusives.
<a href="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/2016/12/best-looking-brands-in-beer-part-2-evil-twin-and-half-acre/halfacre2/" rel="attachment wp-att-921"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-921" src="http://www.mashtunjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/halfacre2-550x393.jpg" alt="halfacre2" width="550" height="393" /></a>

Half Acre embraces the creative process with the design of their labels. President Gabriel Magliaro works with artist and graphic designer, Phineas X. Jones, in marketing and branding their beers. At Half Acre, Magliaro can be considered the creative director, giving Phineas a wide range of material and inspiration to create a label. Sometimes, the idea is only a name; other times, the ideas are specific. But most times, the ideas percolate in the back in the brewery. By the time it reaches Phineas, Magliaro has a fully formed concept in his mind. Phineas filters and interprets these concepts and brings their art to life.

&nbsp;

Phineas works from a blank canvas. That fact alone differentiates Half Acre from other breweries following templates and the usual boring conventions of beer labeling. This approach is what makes Half Acre’s marketing and branding refreshing and fun. And their wide range of artwork, styles, and concepts are what separate Half Acre from the pack.
