Tom Korder and Eric Hobbs know craft beer. They know how to make it, know how to sell it, and certainly know how to talk about it. Mr. Korder and Mr. Hobbs have partnered to open Penrose Brewing Company this fall in Geneva, IL, hoping to create both great beer and a great beer community.</i>

<i>Korder and Hobbs have over a decade of experience in the industry—most recently at Goose Island, where Korder was the brewery manager for 4 1/2 years and Hobbs was a market manager. When Hobbs started thinking of opening a brewery—the kind of brewery he wanted—he knew that it could only exist if Korder signed on to join him.“ I was a good home brewer at the time but that was about it. I was not a professional brewer and I did not want to enter this market—even knowing three years ago how crowded it was getting—without a partner that really knew how to make great beer all the time, build a brewery, manage a brewery. That was what I was looking for and Tom was the guy.” </i>

<i>Interviews are condensed and edited for clarity, but not for content.

<b>Let’s start with the name, Penrose.</b>

HOBBS: Tom found the Penrose tiling pattern when we had shifted away from our original name after trademark concerns. He showed me the tile and got really excited, explaining how the math and the science create this balance between art and science—pretty fitting for a brewery.

<b>
And you have an engineering background?</b>

TOM KORDER: Yes, mechanical engineering.

<b>
So, how’d you go from engineering into brewing?</b>

TK: I went in a different direction than most people. Most people start home brewing and really get into it; I started professionally at the largest brewer in the world, Anheuser-Busch, and worked for them as a manager for about a year and a half. I learned all about beer and I got a very scientific look at how to make <i>consistent</i> beer, time after time. From there I went to one of their bigger breweries in Georgia, and I decided it was getting a little too big and factory for me. I wanted to go to a craft brewer and really make my mark, so I ended up going to Goose Island as the brewery manger running day to day operations. I helped grow and define their barrel program. Then it was really time to branch off on my own. I was looking at some other opportunities but Eric and I met up, and I started listing off things [I wanted in a brewery] and it just meshed there, so we ran with it.

EH: We spent a lot of time figuring out how we wanted this thing to look and feel. We knew right away that we wanted to brew Belgian styles. We started thinking about what we wanted to do with recipes but it was always in the back of our minds that we had to get the whole business side of it figured out.We did months of business planning and delivered a plan to our investors – and these are the same guys we’ve got today. They’ve been with us now for almost three years.

<b>
When I think art meeting science, I think creativity, innovation, complexity. Are these things that you want to inspire your beer?</b>

EH: Absolutely. The hardest thing about brewing is doing something very simple, very clean, making it well, and being consistent. It’s like laying a canvas. Then you can introduce complexity with things like alternative fermentation, wild ales and barrel aging, and that’s where you show that “I really understand the rules and here’s how I bend them.”

Do you have a plan for what you are going to start with?</b>

TK: Yeah we’ve got our four main beers dialed in that we’re working on: “Proto Gradus” and “P2,” a Belgian single and a Belgian pale ale will be our first two. Once those two kind of hit the market, we’ll roll out “Navette,” which is a Belgian Black Ale made with toasted buckwheat. It’s not really a stout, but it has a very dry, nice malt body, and a lot of Belgian yeast character. The fourth will be our French Saison, “Levant.”

EH: We decided to go with the French version of the saison, rather than the Belgian: when we were doing our test batches we just found ourselves gravitating more towards the French style.

TK: Yeah. I mean it was really clean and the Belgian Saison is very spicy at times. It’s kind of the typical saison aroma that most people think of but this one is just a little cleaner and not as spicy.

<b>
You’re also going to have your own in-house lab?</b>

TK: Yes, we’ll be able to do all of our own micro, all of our own cell counts, and make sure what the consumer’s tasting is what we’re tasting. It’s one thing to taste your beer fresh every time but then when the consumer is tasting it, it might be six weeks later, so you need to be doing the same thing. So we’ll do comparative taste panels and all that stuff in house.

EH: There’s too many great brewers out there these days to not have really great beer. That’s why when Tom said he’s going to put a lab in I was like “Yes. That’s awesome.” There’s inevitably going to be somebody that’s gonna be on untappd (the social beer drinking app and service) and say they feel something is wrong with our beer. Context is important: we need to know exactly what a customer is drinking and when they’re drinking it, and when it was made. That way, if there is something wrong we can check; or if they’re just not used to tasting beers -- or they don’t like beers like that -- we can quickly help them understand that we’ve got the same beer sitting in our lab right now, that we’ve tested it and we’re confident in it.

<b>
And you’ve mentioned barrel aging? It looks like you’ve got good space for a program.</b>

TK: Yeah, we’re gonna get a good size barrel program rolling right off the bat so that way we can get some good beers cranking out -- not just have two barrels and call it our “barrel program.”

EH: What we think is important in a barrel program, and what Tom has done so well over at Goose over the years is create vision for what a beer should be, then take different barrels, of varying amounts of oak or funk or acidic character, and blend it into a specific, intended, style. That’s tricky, a lot of people just throw stuff in oak and whatever it is…it’s that.

<b>
Is that where you’re primarily trying to put your footprint?</b>

TK: Well, I wouldn’t say primarily. You’re obviously not going to be able to do that right away. You look at a local distillery, they produce gin and vodka first and they worry about bourbon later because they can. We have to have a year round core line up so that we can do those things. We’re going to start off with “sessionable” Belgian beers that kind of filter into that same vein of barrel aging and alternative fermentation, things like that.

<b>
Are you sourcing the barrels anywhere local?</b>

TK: We’re working on a lot of different avenues for them. Obviously, a lot of the bigger distilleries have more bourbon barrels. Nobody local really has that many bourbon barrels.

EH: Wine barrels are coming from upper Michigan and Wisconsin. We’ve got a lot of different irons in the fire.

<b>
Are there are plans for distribution?</b>

TK: Absolutely. We’ll roll out some market and kegs first. Which is a great way for us to get our name out there and keep the beer fresh.

EH: Right –we want to see what people want to drink. That’s important for us because we know what WE like to drink and we have a pretty good idea of what we anticipate our relative sales being. We think we know which styles people will gravitate towards but you never know so the last thing we want to do is assume what the market wants. Eight counties of the Chicagoland area will be our primary focus and really that is all we’re thinking about right now. The way the whole craft beer industry is going, if you start up now, it isn’t all that likely that you’ll be a big national player. I think you really have to try to go deep in your home market and if that doesn’t work, you’re going to have to take a hard look at yourself and figure out if this is the right thing. So our goal is just to go deep in Chicago because we know that we’re not going to be the most popular, highly rated beers on RateBeer and BeerAdvocate because we’re rolling out really simple, really clean styles with a low ABV. But we do think a lot of craft beer drinkers are gravitating towards those styles more and we’d like to be a little more accessible, a little more available. A lot of the beers we’re going to do are going to play really well in the oak program. So it’s sort of a little cross pollination between projects.

<b>
So do you take any influence from places like Untappd or RateBeer?</b>

EH: Sometimes that might influence us, but it doesn’t change anything. It might help us plan for production amounts and quantities -- but you can watch rating websites and drive yourself insane.

TK: If we developed our business based solely on Beer Advocate ratings we’d be only brewing Citra Hop beers and barrel aging everything.

E: There’s a time and a place for that, and we intend to do some of it, but we love sessionable beers. If I sit down at a place that has only beers with an ABV above 7% that disappoints me. We’re looking towards folks that want to drink some sessionable beers as the starting point.

T: Plus there are 9 million other breweries doing Citra Hop beers, Citra Hop pun names, and that’s just not our style.

<b>
So why Belgian inspired session ales? </b>

TK: From a brewing standpoint there’s a lot of freedom. There aren’t so many set rules. Even a Belgian blonde ale has so many different taste profiles that is nice to know that we can have loose set up guides and just play from that. So that’s why we say “Belgian-inspired” brewing. We play around with a lot of different yeast strains but it’s not like we’re just going to make a double and a triple and a Witte beer, you know? There are so many other ways we can take this.

<b>
Are you going to do any Lambics?</b>

TK: Absolutely. I mean, obviously we’re not in lambics because we’re not in Brussels but we’ll definitely do a lot of wild ales a lot of sours.

EH: We’re going to have 10 handles in the tap room. Eight along the cooler which will be direct draw, but then we’re going to have a separate tower for sours, wilds, and barrel aged stuff. The best part about the tap room is we can be like “you want to come by and taste this? Because we just threw it on, and it’s only going to be on for two days, and we want to see what people think.” It’s like a beautiful focus group. Except people seek it out and then they pay you for it, which is even better

<b>
You guys use “community” a lot in describing your beer and your brewery.</b>

EH: The only way this is successful for any of us is if we grow the community. That has to be everybody’s goal—day one. If we don’t, we all keep going to fish in the same fishing holes. Bangers and Lace has a ton of handles and Ria will always have great beer on there, but that’s just one place. We all have to keep going and finding two or three more Rias to make sure that we figure out how to introduce the rest of the world.

TK: As far as the craft beer community, I mean these are people we’ve been working with for the last 10 years and a lot of the guys that are opening up places now, were at Goose Island when I was there. John Laffler (Off Color Brewing) and Jared Rouben (Moody Tongue Brewing Company), these are guys I’ve been working very closely with for a long time. It’s just a matter of supporting everybody and helping everybody else out.

<b>
You recently did a collaboration with Perennial, do you have any other ones coming up?</b>

EH: The Perennial collaboration we did—this batch that we brought for Chicago Craft Beer Week and some events around here— that was really just kind of a trial to see how it was received. The full-scale collaboration, which will be at retail in bottle and on draft, will be out in October. We’re going back down to Perennial here in a couple weeks to brew with them to get that done. You should be able to get at any of the good craft spots around Chicago.

<b>
Will you have any guest taps in the tasting room?</b>

EH: Wish we could. Legally we’re not allowed to. We were really aware of our position in the community of Geneva. We wanted people to want to sell our beers down the street and so we always said we’re not going to be a brewpub. We’re not going to have food, we’re going to have limited hours. The only way for us to have guest taps would be to have a brewpub license. So no guest taps, at least not for now.

<b>
Do you like the direction everything is going in? </b>

EH: Oh yeah. I’ve been very pleased with how Tom is dialing in on his styles.

TK: Right now it’s just a matter of tweaking. Do I like 10 percent buckwheat or 15 percent? It’s just kind of seeing the little subtle differences.

EH: We’ve played with some flavors too. We might do one for the market and then we might add lemon grass or green coriander or something like that just to kind of change it up a little bit [for our tap room.] And if we think this is something we like better, then we can just do it that way.

<b>
So, you’re starting with the kegs and market, then the tap room, then package and distribution. What’s next after that?</b>

EH: Honestly, for us, like I said we want to go deep in Chicago. There’s no reason to rush.

TK: We don’t want to rush it. It’s a matter of doing it well here and then we can worry about other stuff later.

<b>
I’m sure anyone who home brews, brews professionally, they probably dream about being able to do this. For you, it’s almost here. How do you feel?</b>

TK: Everyday there’s something more exciting. Like yesterday when I was pulling those (fermenters) in, it was just crazy. And when I get to be in here and I mapped out and taped out everything. It’s another step. And one of these days we’ll have beer and it will be just surreal. I’ll look back at these last three years and think “where’d that time go?” I mean hundreds of pages of business plans and recipe development and just thinking about what we want to do and different properties we’ve looked at. It’s just kind of surreal right now.
