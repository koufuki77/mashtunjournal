We are super excited about the party at the Co-Prosperity Sphere on November 15. It's a Dungeons &amp; Dragons inspired art show and happening featuring a beer made by Three Floyds, especially for the event. The delicious sessionable Amber Ale will pour all night as you enjoy the sounds of Sun Splitter and Sybaris. The event is from 7pm -11pm with an 8-hour D &amp; D gaming tournament afterwards.
