<em>Interviewed by Ed Marszewski</em>

&nbsp;

Rick and Ron Chapman opened Coronado Brewing Company almost 20 years ago on the island of Coronado, across the bay from San Diego. The brewery started as a small neighborhood brewpub around the same time as Ballast Point, Stone, and AleSmith. Together, those breweries formed the San Diego Brewers Guild, and over time Coronado and the guild birthed the “West Coast” beer styles that we have come to love and adore.

&nbsp;

At the moment, Coronado isn’t as well known to Midwestern beer drinkers as Stone or Ballast Point, but in late-2015 they entered a distribution contract with Wirtz Beverage and have just started rolling out the barrels here in Chicagoland. In 2014, the brewery won best Mid-Sized Brewery and Brewer at the World Beer Cup, taking a prize with their Islander IPA. And if the liquid continues to taste as good as the ones we’ve tried, we expect them to do well here in the beer capital of the Midwest.

&nbsp;

We hooked up with Rick Chapman and Head Brewer Ryan Brooks at Mash Tun HQ a few days before they were heading to FoBAB and asked them to tell their story.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>How did you start your brewery?</em>

&nbsp;

Rick Chapman: My brother Ron and I opened the brewery 20 years ago. It had always been a dream of ours to have a brewery. And 20 years ago we put together a business plan, bought the property almost 150 yards from the home we grew up in, and plucked down a little brewpub.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>So you started off with a brewpub that had a restaurant, a taproom, and a small brewing facility. What was the size of your system back then?</em>

&nbsp;

Rick: It’s a 10-barrel system and it’s still there. We’ve become a brewpub on steroids. We bought the building next door and we put in 13 20-barrel fermenters. We put out 6,000 barrels a year from there until we built our production facility about three and a half years ago.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>So three and a half years ago you opened a production brewery and started making beer to send to other markets? </em>

&nbsp;

Rick: We started getting into the distribution game in Southern California mostly, but then some other markets outside. Pennsylvania was the first out-of-state market we came to out, about nine year ago.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>Ron, were you one of the brewers back when you first started?</em>

&nbsp;

Rick: No, we asked one of our baristas, Sean Dewitt, if he wanted to be a partner. He became one of our head brewers. 20 years later, he’s become our director of brewing operations. So, he’s our head brewer but he doesn’t brew any longer – he brews with Ryan’s team.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>Ryan, when did you start at Coronado?</em>

&nbsp;

Ryan: I worked at a brewing facility about an hour north of San Diego for a few years, and I wanted to get to San Diego where the big dogs were. I interviewed at Stone in the morning and at Coronado in the afternoon, and 15 minutes after I left, Sean, the Director of Operations said, “Hey, you want to start on Tuesday?” That was almost four years ago.

&nbsp;

Rick: Did Stone call you back?

&nbsp;

Ryan: After two weeks – and I’d started at Coronado already, so it didn’t matter.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>You were based in California, and you got involved in brewing because…?</em>

&nbsp;

Ryan: I was cheap. I was playing in a punk rock band touring the world and I liked good beer. But I couldn’t afford a lot of it so I started home brewing.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>That’s a common story. I know many musicians here in Chicago that were homebrewing, and then some of them actually went on to open up nanobreweries or work for breweries. It was pretty fun to go get bootleg brews for $5 a bottle in somebody’s apartment on the West Side. </em>

&nbsp;

Ryan: It was fun.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>The Coronado portfolio of beers is pretty diverse today. But I bet almost 20 years ago, when you first opened up the brewpub, you had to have your standards: amber ale, golden ale, porter, pale ale, maybe an oatmeal stout. When did you get involved with the West Coast IPA freak out phase?</em>

&nbsp;

Rick: It was happening when we opened. Stone started doing IPAs. AleSmith did some IPAs. And we were part of that. It was the San Diego Brewers Guild that kept us all together. So everybody experimented and tried different things, and through that process we defined the West Coast IPA.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>When do you think that the dominance of the IPA hit the country? Do you recall when, all of a sudden, you couldn’t make enough IPA? </em>

&nbsp;

Rick: Probably only about five or six years ago.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>The one thing I hear about San Diego is that it’s just about as easy to grab a fresh craft beer as it is to get a Corona or some other macro beer.</em>

&nbsp;

Rick: I’ve been on the sales side for years, so that’s where I’ve seen the difference. In the last three or four years you have a lot more access to the buyers, especially the big chains and the big restaurants. Before, we were just pounding on doors and trying to get people to talk to us.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>Glad to hear that people in these corporate chains understand the value that craft beer has in the marketplace. Do you think the acceptance of craft beer in chain stores has been driving the expansion of craft beer volume sales?</em>

&nbsp;

Rick: That’s a piece of it. On premise, off premise. Working with each other to build brands. But, yes, the expansion of craft beer in chain stores is helping a lot to build brands.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Edmar: Your company is expanding, you have two facilities and a tasting room, and you also make trips to Europe to purchase your hops directly from growers. Do you think that the large macro brewers like the AB InBev and SABMiller conglomerate will make it more difficult for independent breweries like yours? Some have argued that the big breweries are going to make it harder for the craft breweries to purchase the raw materials it takes to make their brews. Do you think any of this is something that you have to think about in the near future?

&nbsp;

Ryan: Absolutely.

&nbsp;

Rick: We think about it. I’ve never heard that directly from any of the big guys. So in what I’ve seen from the outside they pretty much let you run the way you want to. They don’t know how to run a craft brewery. We’re entwined in our culture and our communities. But when they do take over your company you have a lot more resources. It’s like Ballast Point. They are growing at 140%. How do you finance that? Go public or …take the other door.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>It’s pretty amazing what happened with Ballast Point and their purchase by Constellation Brands. In light of that, and the purchase of half of Lagunitas by Heineken, do you think there are going to be problems with commodity pricing or shortages because of the growth of the craft beer segment?</em>

&nbsp;

Ryan: I’m nervous about it. I’ve seen hops going from $4-6 per pound to $15-20 per pound in the past few years. So that’s just something to keep in the back of your mind. It takes time to grow these products, you can’t just say overnight, “Hey, I’m gonna grow more barley and open up these malting facilities.”

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>Even on the packaging side, you have companies like Crown Packaging, who are restricting the availability of their cans. They are not opening up any new accounts for people who want to do canning. In general, there seems to be kind of a disruptive moment in the overall macro beer industry, which has seen a period of decline over the past decade. Beer as a total volume of sales of alcoholic beverages has gone down, and of course the craft beer industry has taken over a portion of Big Beer’s overall sales. So it is really a very interesting phenomenon to see how rapidly craft beer is growing, and how some of the larger companies have been absorbed by the Big Beer Borg. Did you ever think that craft beer would become such a raging phenomenon?</em>

&nbsp;

Rick: Yes, I did. You’ve seen how the market has grown steadily 11-15% over the last ten years. Before the dip. So, yeah, it’s been happening and now there are just more and more breweries. There are also a lot of options in access to financing. The venture capitalists are getting into it, the banks are soliciting us, it’s kinda the same issues we had with the chains. You couldn’t get their attention at all a few years back, but now they’re at every conference, they’re calling us multiple times a week. I saw it coming. And maybe it’s come a little faster than I would have anticipated, but it’s definitely here, and it’s here to stay.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>Yeah, I think so, too. I believe we are entering a larger cultural shift marked by a rejection of mass-produced, monocultural products, especially beer. So I think the craft beer culture and business is going to grow. What do you guys want to have happen in Chicago? You’ve just released a new beer…</em>

&nbsp;

Ryan: Stingray IPA is a big badass double IPA, not a lot of malt flavors, tons of hops, it’s got Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe, Southern Cross, all the cool sexy hops.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>The dream hops combo potion. So the Stingray IPA is hot shit? What other brews do you make that people would dig out here? </em>

&nbsp;

Ryan: We’re doing cans pretty soon, too. Those are coming out hopefully in March. We’re going to package the beer we won the award with – the Islander IPA. We’re also doing our Orange Avenue Wit, and a pale ale. I hope in the future we can do a light lager, just so we can crush a lot of beers on the beach.

&nbsp;

Rick: We like making balanced beers, so the majority of our portfolio, like the Orange Avenue Wit, the Mermaid’s Red amber ale – even our Islander isn’t a big hop bomb – it’s flavorful.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>It’s important to have balanced, clean beers that you can enjoy on any occasion. Do you think that with the coming shortage of Citra, Mosaic hops, etc., that you are going to see a lot of different breweries making these different lighter beers as well? </em>

&nbsp;

Rick: Belgian style beers don’t require a lot of hops.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>Do you guys foresee yourselves opening up new facilities outside of California? </em>

&nbsp;

Rick: Eventually. Europe. And an East Coast presence. Maybe five years down the line – we have a lot going on in our home market with room for growth.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>I’m actually surprised that you didn’t try to go completely bonkers 4-5 years ago. What happened?</em>

&nbsp;

Rick: As far as growth? Growth has to come naturally. You can only push so much, you have to have the pull. We’ve just grown organically and gotten better and better. That’s why we built the production facility to accommodate the growth. But we didn’t build a massive facility because we didn’t have it. You have to keep one foot on the gas and one on the brake. Sometimes the gas is going a little hard. We thought we would get 10 years out of the facility that we are in now, and we’re coming up on year four and we will mostly likely outgrow it next year. Fortunately, we’ve got the property adjacent to it, so we can double that to buy us another four or five years. And that’s maybe where that East Coast presence is going to enter into the equation for shipping and all that.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>One more question: Do you have any advice for the new generation of breweries that are opening up all over the universe, from nano-sized one man shows to investment groups opening 30-50-barrel systems out of the gate?</em>

&nbsp;

Rick: Do it to make great beer and the rest will follow. Don’t do it thinking you’re gonna get rich, ‘cause it takes a long time to get profitable.

&nbsp;

Ryan: Quality definitely is important. I see a lot of new young brewers going out and starting businesses because their friends or their mom said they make really good beer. I think you gotta be really critical of your beer and strive for strong quality of the product.

&nbsp;

Edmar: <em>Thanks, guys!</em>
