It’s not likely that the principal partners at Hop Head Farms -- an important new hop-growing project in southwestern Michigan -- would ever have crossed paths but for one thing: they love craft beer.

Nunzino Pizza, a son of Italian immigrants, grew up in the working class west Chicago suburb of Berwyn. Though he aspired as a youth to be an artist, a mailroom job at the Chicago Board of Trade led to a lucrative career as a commodities trader. This, in turn, provided him with capital that he invested several years ago in a startup brewpub that you may have heard of -- Revolution Brewing. Revolution has not only been successful in its own right, but has been the engine for an economic revival in Chicago’s long-sagging Logan Square neighborhood.

Jeff Steinman grew up across Lake Michigan in the shore resort town of St. Joseph, Michigan. Steinman obtained a degree in ornamental horticulture from Michigan State University and worked at plant nurseries for many years. He later moved to a part of rural southwestern Michigan not far from tiny Hickory Corners, where Hop Heads Farms now is located.

Bonnie Steinman, Jeff’s wife, grew up in a Detroit suburb but had family who farmed in southwestern Michigan She developed a lifelong fondness for gardening and ultimately, an expertise in integrated pest management. The Steinmans loved to drink craft beer, which led them into experiments in hop-growing, first in a backyard plot and then on three-fifths of an acre of rented land, part of a grant-funded organic hop project.

The three connected in the summer of 2011. A handful of hop-growing pioneers had sparked a revival beginning in 2006 by planting a few dozen acres up north in the Traverse City area. Pizza had researched and determined that growing hops in Michigan could become a big thing, ultimately challenging the century-long dominance of three northwestern states: Washington, Oregon and Idaho.

Tapping both his backgrounds in agricultural commodity trading and Chicago craft brewing, he came up with a plan for a multi-million dollar project financed by himself and other investors, and then conducted a search for “the right people that could handle production and quality.”

He and the Steinmans hit it off almost immediately. “Jeff and Bonnie were at the very frontier of it all,” Pizza said. For Steinman, who wanted to expand beyond the couple’s little starter plots, “it was an opportunity to jump in with both feet.” They also wasted no time, taking less than a year to go from a proposal to putting 15,000 plants of five different hop varieties in the ground across 15 acres.

The farm, located about a half-hour drive northeast of Kalamazoo and northwest of Battle Creek, has up to 40 arable acres, and the Steinmans hope to double their cultivation in 2015.

They rolled high on a brand new, German-made Wolf WHE-513 harvesting machine that cost a sweet $250,000, a price that has prompted most small growers to rely on used, reconditioned equipment. They have built their own processing facility, enabling on-site handling of the fragile flower ”cones”, the part of the hop vines that go into beer, and hope this will prompt other local farmers to start growing hops themselves.

They have also taken leadership in creating a consortium of Michigan hop growers and brewers a supportive community of mutual aid, especially since many microbreweries like to promote themselves as part of the “buy local” movement. The Steinmans organized a symposium at Hickory Corners’ one tourist attraction, the Gilmore vintage car museum, on March 3 -- more than two months before Hop Head Farms began its first planting.

<em>Nunio, Bonnie &amp; Jeff</em>

<b>Bitter Can Be Sweet</b>

<i>Humulus Lupulus </i>is not a wizarding incantation from the Harry Potter stories. Rather, it is the Latin genus name for the vine plant that produces the cone-shaped flowers known as hops. It is from the family <i>Cannabinaceae</i>, which, yes, includes cannabis, more familiarly known in its varieties as “marijuana” or “hemp.”

Short’s, a craft brewery located in the northern Michigan town of Elk Rapids, pays tribute with an India Pale Ale called Huma Lupa Licious, described on the label as “a complex malt and hop theme park in your mouth.”

According to the <i>Oxford Companion to Beer</i>, hops “are the ingredient in beer that provides its backbone of bitterness, increases its microbiological stability, and greatly influences its taste and aroma.” Depending on which kind of hop is used -- a guide on Beer Advocate’s website lists 30 different varieties -- the flowers can impart flavors that are fruity, floral, herbal, resiny or sweet.

The other great definer is the degree of bitterness, measured in International Bittering Units (IBUs), imparted by hops. All beers have hops, though it can be hard to tell, especially with the very light beers that have long dominated the American market. On a scale from 0 (lowest) to 120 (hoppiest), beers such as Miller Lite, Bud Light and Coors Light come in at about 10. That compares to around 40 for a traditional Bohemian pilsner, 40-70 for American IPA, 50-90 for Russian Imperial Stout and a mouth-puckering range of 60-120 for Imperial IPA.

Until the 1970s, nearly all the domestic beer consumed in the United States was of the lighter varieties. But with the advent of craft brewing pioneers such as Sierra Nevada and Anchor Steam in California in the late 1970s, and Boston Beer Company (better known for its brand name Samuel Adams) in the early 1980s, it soon became clear a beer-drinking revolution was under way. Microbreweries cropped up across the country, including now-nationally known outfits such as Goose Island in Pizza’s hometown of Chicago (bought out by InBev Anheuser Busch in 2011) and Bell’s in Kalamazoo, not far from where the Steinmans live. The new wave of microbreweries not only featured beers that were brewed in small batches, but ones that featured higher IBUs on their labels. Revolution, the Chicago brewpub, has several recipes tailored to the growing numbers of hoppy beer cultists. Their “Double Fist,” with an IBU of 90, is described on their website as a “strong pale ale [that] packs a serious punch with massive hop flavor.”

<b>Art vs. Availability</b>

Pizza says he met Josh Deth, the developer of Revolution, at a point in his life when he was ready for a change from commodity trading. And the craftsmanship from which craft brewing derives its name appealed to his artistic side.

“Everyone I meet here has had some passion for artisanship,” Pizza said.

But he also learned a practical reality. Hops can be hard to obtain in the quantities that brewers need. A warehouse fire in Yakima, Wash., that destroyed 4 percent of the U.S. hop crop in 2006 combined with an international shortage caused mainly by bad weather in Europe in 2007 to put price and supply pressures on microbrewers. Mass brewers’ long-term contracts give them first dibs when there is a crunch, leaving the micros with few options.

This planted the idea in Pizza’s head of starting a farm accessible to Midwestern artisan brewers that could help them deal with supply issues and where they could, as he put it, “seeit and touch it while it was growing.” Michigan, where outfits up north such as the Michigan Hop Alliance and Old Mission Hop Exchange were already processing the crop, emerged as the favorite locale for the project.

Michigan already had a hop-growing industry in the 19th century. But it was undermined by pests and disease just as the hop farms in the Pacific Northwest were becoming established and transportation improvements made shipping the crop long distances viable, according to Rob Sirrine, who specializes in hops at Michigan State University’s extension service at Suttons Bay.

But Sirrine -- who organizes an annual tour of hop farms in the Traverse City area for current and prospective growers each August -- added that there is no reason hops should not be able to thrive in Michigan. “They grow anywhere from 35 to 55 latitude, so we’re right smack in the middle of that right here on the 45th parallel,” said Sirrine, who added that hop vines “grow kind of like a weed.” He also said that the sandy, well-drained soil of the region is perfect for growing hops.

<b>Small Can Be Big</b>

No one is yet claiming that Michigan will elbow the Pacific Northwest states aside in the niche world of hop growing anytime soon. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistical Survey issued an annual report on December 21, 2011, and it still recognized only Washington (23,320 acres in cultivation last year), Oregon (4,202 acres) and Idaho (2,265 acres) as hop-producing states. Michigan, with an estimaded 100+ acres of hops planted even with the addition of Hop Head Farms, clearly has a long way to go.But Sirrine said hops could become a growing business in a state that, because of the longstanding troubles of the state’s auto industry, has a crying need for diversification. One reason, according to Sirrine, is that the smaller-scale operations rising up in Michigan can provide more of the small-batch quality desired by microbrewers than the big operations out West.<a href="#_msocom_1">[smd1]</a>

“That’s where I think we can compete with them because they’ll load the hops in there about three feet deep with these huge furnaces underneath and they’ll run them at 140 degrees,” Sirrine said. “Here, we can dry them at a lower temperature because we don’t have as much to dry. If you dry them at 110, then there’s less degradation of quality.”

Then there is the issue of proximity to the growing community of craft brewers in Michigan and nearby states such as Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. Jeff Steinman points out that Hop Head Farms is located within about an hour’s drive of between 20 to 30 breweries. Steinman said his farm is well-positioned to fulfill short turnaround orders, because their state-of-the-art picker will be capable of clearing a half-acre per hour of their Cascade, Centennial, Chinook, Magnum and Nugget hops.

There are plenty of brewpubs, too, such as the Walldorf in nearby Hastings, whose brewmaster, Sam Sherwood, has contracted to use hops from Hop Head Farms. “The brewpubs are thrilled,” said Bonnie Steinman. “[But] it’s a slippery slope until you get established.”

Not surprisingly, brewers are taking a “trust but verify” approach to the hop revival. Nonetheless, Pizza’s connection to the Chicago beer world is extending his farm’s range to a city where craft brewing is rapidly expanding, creating not only a market for dried hop pellets (used in most beers) but also for wet hops right off the vine, used in seasonal harvest ales and for which absolute freshness is crucial.

Their prospective Chicago customers include Greg Shuff and Brant Dubovick, the principals at DryHop, a brewpub that they expect to open next winter in Chicago’s Lakeview East community.

Dubovick, the head brewer who formerly held a similar position at Pittsburgh’s famed Church Brew Works, said about wet-hopping: “We’ve already talked to Nunzino and he told us that he’d meet us halfway between Chicago and Michigan. Drop them off at a rest stop.” Shuff, DryHop’s owner joked: “Yeah, we’ll do a deal.” Dubovick added, “I have every reason to believe it’s going to be a quality product. We’d like to be a farm-to-table brewery, buying Wisconsin hops and Michigan hops.”

This year’s difficult weather conditions, marked by excessive heat and little rain, made the first year challenging at Hop Head Farms. But thanks to an irrigation system and a lot of TLC, by mid-Agusutthe plants were healthy and green, and some were already flowering. They were just a little shorter than the partners had hoped.

But Pizza is bullish that the always-risky investment he has made in an agricultural venture will pay off. “It’s just changing everyone’s old opinions about where [hops] can be grown,” he said. “We’re not the first. We’re just going to be the best.”
