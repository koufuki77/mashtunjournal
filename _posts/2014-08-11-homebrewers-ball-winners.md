It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon for a beer festival in our Chicago neighborhood of Bridgeport, known as "The Community of the Future."  Many Homebrewers and beer enthusiasts that did not go to the <a href="http://greattaste.org/">Great Taste of the Midwest</a> in Madison, Wisconsin made their way down to our gallery, <a href="http://www.coprosperity.org">The Co-Prosperity Sphere</a>, to participate in our first annual Homebrewer's Ball.

This year we had twenty two entries that competed to win the prize of having their liquid entry made by our new brewery, <a href="http://www.marzbrewing.com">Marz Community Brewing Company</a>. Our Marz project started about the same time as<em> Mash Tun: A Craft Beer Journal </em>some two years ago. After a grueling wait, we are finally up and running and are making some exceptional and delicious brews. You can try them all the time at <a href="http://community-bar.com">Maria's Packaged Goods &amp; Community Bar</a> and other fine drinking establishments throughout Illinois, if yer interested. We also poured a few brews at the Ball to let these Homebrewers know we are not fucking around.

We were delighted that over 140 people showed up to vote for the final four beers that would be entered in the final round of judging by Master Cicerone, David Kahle, Marz Brewing brewer, Tim Lange, and Beer Superfreak and CHAOS Hombrewers club member, Eric Padilla.

While we were waiting for the final vote tally and judging we treated everyone to The Doner Men Food truck. If you are smart you will follow them on <a href="https://twitter.com/DMenTruck">Twitter</a> and figure out a way to try their German Stye doner wraps, and curry wurst. My god it's good. And the food pairs perfectly with beer. Attendees were also able to procure an on the spot silk-screened t-shirt, tote bag and/or bar towell from our best buds at <a href="http://www.teetsy.com/">Teetsy</a>!
