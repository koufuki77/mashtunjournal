The Mash Tun Society is a craft beer and artisan food club that presents programming throughout the year in the city of Chicago. The Society was established for people who enjoy the pleasures and aesthetics of craft beer and how it intersects with food, culture, &amp; society. The Non profit organization publishes The Mash Tun Journal and produces many events and programs like the Mash Tun Festivals, The Homebrewers Ball, the annual Art of Beer exhibition and other exclusive drinking and eating events and gatherings.
